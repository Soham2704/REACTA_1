        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 07, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 1500 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Island City\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 15.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 15.0 m.\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 1500 sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 3.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 1497.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b970.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe analysis confirms that the proposed building height is compliant with the single regulation provided, which governs height based on road width. The plot\u2019s 15.0 m road width places it within the category allowing up to 25.0 m in height.\n\nHowever, the provided regulatory context is critically deficient in specifying the Floor Space Index (FSI) or Floor Area Ratio (FAR) entitlements for the Residential (R-Zone) in the Island City location. As a result, the maximum permissible built-up area (BUA) and corresponding financial implications for premium FSI cannot be calculated. The analysis is therefore limited to height compliance only.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **Maximum Permissible Height:** The proposed building height (15.0 m) is permissible as the plot abuts a 15.0 m wide road, falling within the 12m\u201318m road width category, which allows a maximum height of 25.0 m. (Raw Text Excerpt, Applicability Conditions: road_width_m min 12, max 18).\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nBased on the available context, only the height entitlement can be confirmed. All density calculations (FSI, BUA) are currently indeterminate.\n\n| Entitlement Parameter | Value | Compliance Status |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Abutting Road Width** | 15.0 m | Applicable |\n| **Maximum Permissible Height** | 25.0 m | N/A (Regulatory Limit) |\n| **Proposed Building Height** | 15.0 m | Compliant |\n| **Base FSI Entitlement** | Undetermined | Critical Data Missing |\n| **Max Buildable Area (BUA)** | Undetermined | Cannot be Calculated |\n\n**Detailed Calculation Summary (Based on Net Plot Area of 1497.0 sq. m.):**\n\n| Calculation Element | Formula / Rule Applied | Result |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Base FSI Area** | Net Plot Area * Base FSI | Cannot be calculated (FSI missing) |\n| **Total Permissible BUA** | Base FSI Area + Premium FSI Area | Cannot be calculated |\n| **Premium FSI Area** | Undetermined | Cannot be calculated |\n| **ASR Rate** | Provided Parameter | \u20b970.0 / sq.m. |\n| **Premium FSI Cost** | 0.5 * ASR * Premium FSI Area | Cost cannot be calculated |\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nThe analysis is severely constrained by the absence of core development control regulations. The following information is critically needed to provide a comprehensive report:\n\n1.  **Applicable FSI/FAR:** The specific Base FSI and Maximum Permissible FSI (including Premium FSI) for Residential (R-Zone) plots within the Island City location.\n2.  **Setback Requirements:** Mandatory front, rear, and side setbacks (open spaces) specific to plots abutting 15.0 m roads.\n3.  **Maximum Ground Coverage (MGC):** The percentage of the plot area that can be covered by the building footprint.\n4.  **Premium FSI Rules:** The specific rate of Premium FSI allowed and the conditions for its approval (e.g., higher road width requirement, mandatory payment).\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Immediate Regulatory Retrieval:** Locate the full Development Control Regulations (DCR) or Unified Development Code (UDC) applicable to the **Residential (R-Zone) in the Island City** jurisdiction. The primary focus must be on obtaining the mandated FSI table.\n2.  **Setback Confirmation:** Determine the minimum required open spaces to finalize the maximum allowable footprint (Ground Coverage).\n3.  **Density Strategy:** Once the Base and Premium FSI values are known, calculate the maximum potential BUA and structure the financial strategy for utilizing Premium FSI, given the ASR rate of \u20b970.0/sq.m.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided context and user parameters as of December 07, 2025. This analysis should not be used as a substitute for professional legal advice or official municipal approval. All calculations and compliance assessments are pending the retrieval of complete and verified FSI regulations.",
