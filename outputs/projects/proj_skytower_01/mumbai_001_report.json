        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 07, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** urban\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 17.0\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nBased on the parameters provided, the development potential is analyzed under the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034). Given the context excerpts, the analysis assumes the plot is located within the **Island City** area, which specifies the highest FSI entitlements based on road width.\n\nThe abutting road width of 20.0 meters places the plot within the high-density development category (18.00m & above but less than 27m). The maximum permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) for a Residential (R-Zone) use on this plot is **2.70**, achievable through a combination of Zonal (Basic) FSI, Additional FSI upon premium payment, and Admissible Transferable Development Rights (TDR).\n\nKey entitlements derived from the regulations include:\n\n1.  **Basic Entitlement (Zonal FSI):** The base entitlement is 1.33 FSI.\n2.  **Premium FSI:** An additional FSI of 0.73 is permissible upon payment of a premium, calculated at 50% of the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR) for the Built-Up Area (BUA).\n3.  **TDR Utilization:** An Admissible TDR component of 0.64 FSI is available for utilization, subject to procurement and specific TDR regulations.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   DCPR-2034, TABLE 12, Column 7 (Permissible FSI): 2.7 (Page 83)\n*   DCPR-2034, TABLE 12, Row: 18.00m & above but less than 27m (Page 83)\n*   DCPR-2034, Regulation 30(A)(6) (Premium Calculation): Premium shall be charged for \u2018additional FSI on payment of premium\u2019 at the rate of 50% of the land rates as per ASR (Page 85)\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe calculations below determine the maximum allowable Built-Up Area (BUA) for the proposed residential development, assuming full utilization of all available FSI components (Zonal, Premium, and TDR).\n\n| FSI Component | FSI Value | Calculation (2000 sq. m. * FSI) | Built-Up Area (sq. m.) | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. Zonal (Basic) FSI** | 1.33 | 2000 * 1.33 | 2660.0 | Base entitlement. |\n| **2. Additional FSI (Premium)** | 0.73 | 2000 * 0.73 | 1460.0 | Requires premium payment (50% ASR). |\n| **3. Admissible TDR** | 0.64 | 2000 * 0.64 | 1280.0 | Requires TDR certificates procurement. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.70** | | | |\n| **Maximum Total BUA** | | | **5400.0 sq. m.** | |\n\n**Summary of Calculations:**\n\n*   **Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m.\n*   **Maximum Permissible FSI:** 2.70\n*   **Maximum Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA):** 5400 sq. m.\n\n*Note: The BUA calculations exclude areas typically exempted from FSI computation (e.g., parking, balconies, specific services) as per broader DCPR-2034 regulations not detailed in the provided context.*\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile the FSI potential is clearly defined by the road width and zoning, the following critical information is missing from the provided context and user query, which may impact project feasibility:\n\n1.  **Specific Location Confirmation:** The analysis relies on the FSI table for the \"Island City\" (Mumbai) category. If the plot falls under the suburbs or extended suburbs, the Zonal and Permissible FSI figures would be different, potentially lowering the maximum BUA.\n2.  **Height and Setback Regulations:** The proposed height (17.0 m) must comply with specific height restrictions, which are typically governed by the required front, side, and rear setbacks relative to the road width and plot size. The context does not provide these dimensional planning rules.\n3.  **Annual Statement of Rates (ASR):** The cost of the 1460 sq. m. of Premium FSI cannot be calculated without the current Annual Statement of Rates (ASR) for the specific location, as the premium is 50% of the ASR land rate (for FSI 1).\n4.  **Existing Reservations/Road Widening:** It is assumed the entire 2000 sq. m. is the net plot area available for FSI calculation. If any part of the plot is reserved or required to be surrendered for road widening (Regulation 16, 17), the net plot area will decrease, thus reducing the maximum BUA entitlement.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nTo proceed with the development application, the user should undertake the following actions:\n\n1.  **Confirm Location and Zoning Certificate:** Obtain a certified extract of the Development Plan (DP) sheet to confirm the exact location (Island City vs. Suburbs) and verify the zoning status, ensuring no specific reservations affect the plot area.\n2.  **Determine Setback Requirements:** Consult the relevant section of DCPR-2034 (likely Part IV or equivalent) regarding minimum front, side, and rear setbacks, and maximum permissible height for a 20.0 m road width to ensure the proposed 17.0 m height is compliant.\n3.  **Financial Feasibility Study:** Calculate the precise premium cost for the 1460 sq. m. of Additional FSI using the current year's ASR for the specific locality. This is crucial for determining the project's financial viability.\n4.  **TDR Strategy:** Develop a strategy for procuring the necessary TDR certificates (equivalent to 1280 sq. m. BUA) or assess the market cost of TDR utilization.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the textual excerpts provided from the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034) and the specific parameters supplied by the user.
