Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\nBased on the provided parameters, the system has identified applicable rules from the master database. \n**Key Finding:** The plot is located in a urban zone with a road width of 20m. This typically allows for standard FSI with potential bonuses.\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n*   **Base FSI:** 1.0 (Standard)\n*   **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n*   **Total Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA):** 2000.0 sq. m. (Estimated)\n*   **Setbacks:** Standard setbacks apply (typically 6m front, 4.5m sides) based on the building height.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n*   Specific ward-level regulations (only City-level rules applied).\n*   Detailed topography map for slope analysis.\n*   Existing structures on site (if any).\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n1.  Verify the exact road width with a physical survey.\n2.  Purchase applicable TDR (Transferable Development Rights) to increase FSI potential.\n3.  Consult with a local liaison architect for final approval submission.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is generated in **Offline Mode** as the AI service is unavailable.
