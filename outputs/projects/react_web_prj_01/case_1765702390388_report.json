Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\nBased on the provided regulations, a residential building on a 2000 sq. m. plot in a residential zone (R-Zone) with a proposed height of 15.0 m is generally permissible. The primary applicable rules for development controls (Ground Coverage, FAR, and Height) are derived from the general residential plotted development standards, which categorize plots by size. For plots \"Above 500 - 2000 sq. m.\", a maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 120 (equivalent to 1.2 FSI) and a maximum Ground Coverage of 60% are specified, with height restricted to \"Below 15m\". The proposed height of 15.0 m is at the upper limit of this category. Specific regulations for \"Zone A (Walled City)\" that differentiate from these general residential norms are not explicitly provided in the context, so the general residential standards are assumed to apply.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **Development Controls for Residential Plots (Ground Coverage, FAR, Height):** Page 90, Table-like structure \"Above 500 - 2000 60 120 | Below15m\"\n*   **Parking Provisions:** Page 90, Note 4 (\"For plots above 300 sq.m, provision for parking and loading / unloading shall be made by the owners within their plots.\") and Page 69, Para 5.6.7 (\"Parking provisions shall be as per prevailing norms for residential plotted development...\").\n*   **Basement Use:** Page 90, Note 5 (\"Provision / use of basement shall be as per the stipulations of MPD-2021.\")\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\nUsing the Net Plot Area of 1992.0 sq. m.:\n\n| Entitlement/Calculation | Value | Notes |\n| :---------------------- | :---- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Permissible Ground Coverage** | 60% | Based on plot size \"Above 500 - 2000 sq. m.\" (Page 90). |\n| **Permissible Ground Coverage Area** | 1195.2 sq. m. | 60% of 1992.0 sq. m. |\n| **Base FSI (FAR)** | 1.2 | Corresponds to 120 FAR for plots \"Above 500 - 2000 sq. m.\" (Page 90). |\n| **Premium FSI** | Not directly calculable | The provided context does not specify premium FSI provisions for standard residential plots of this size. |\n| **TDR (Transferable Development Rights)** | Not applicable | The provided context does not mention TDR provisions for standard residential plots of this size. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | 1.2 | Based on Base FSI. |\n| **Total Permissible BUA (Built-Up Area)** | 2390.4 sq. m. | 1.2 (FSI) * 1992.0 sq. m. (Net Plot Area). |\n| **Permissible Height** | Below 15.0 m | For plots \"Above 500 - 2000 sq. m.\" (Page 90). Proposed height (15.0 m) is at the limit. |\n\n**Financials:**\nSince Premium FSI is not explicitly defined or calculable for this specific residential plot type and size based on the provided context, the cost calculation for Premium FSI area cannot be performed.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\nWhile a comprehensive analysis has been provided based on available rules, the following information is critical and missing for a more precise assessment:\n*   **Specific Zoning Regulations for \"Zone A (Walled City)\":** The analysis assumes general residential development controls apply. Zone A, being a \"Walled City,\" might have unique heritage, conservation, or density restrictions not detailed in the provided excerpts.\n*   **Detailed Parking Standards:** While the context mentions parking provision within plots for sizes above 300 sq. m., a specific ECS (Equivalent Car Space) per 100 sq. m. of floor area for residential buildings of this size is not explicitly provided.\n*   **Setback Requirements:** Specific setback norms for residential plots of this size are not detailed in the provided context.\n*   **Premium FSI and TDR Mechanisms for Residential Plots:** The context does not outline provisions for Premium FSI or TDR for standard residential plots, which could potentially increase the permissible BUA.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Recommendation (AI Policy)**\n**Recommended Strategy:** LOW DENSITY Residential (Basic FSI ~1.0)\n\nAlthough the maximum permissible FSI for your plot size is 1.2, adopting a strategy of \"LOW DENSITY Residential\" with a Basic FSI of approximately 1.0 (which is slightly below the maximum) is a sound approach for this location. The plot size of 2000 sq. m. combined with a 20.0 m abutting road width supports a moderate density development. While the road is sufficiently wide to handle the traffic generated by a 1.2 FSI development, opting for a slightly lower density (like 1.0 FSI) could provide enhanced open spaces, better daylighting, and improved quality of life for residents, which is often desirable in established areas like a \"Walled City\" (Zone A). This strategy balances development potential with urban amenity considerations, ensuring the building remains within the permissible height of below 15.0 m.\n\n#### **5. Next Steps**\n1.  **Verify Zone-Specific Regulations:** Immediately consult the local planning authority for specific development controls pertaining to \"Zone A (Walled City)\" to confirm if any additional or overriding regulations apply to residential plots within this sensitive area.\n2.  **Detailed Building Bye-Laws Review:** Obtain the full set of municipal building bye-laws to ascertain precise setback requirements, ground coverage calculations, and specific parking standards (e.g., ECS per dwelling unit or per 100 sq. m. of BUA) for residential buildings of this scale.\n3.  **Feasibility Study for Premium FSI/TDR:** Inquire with the local body about any provisions for Premium FSI or TDR that may be applicable to residential developments, even if not explicitly detailed in the provided excerpts, and their associated costs.\n4.  **Architectural Design & Compliance:** Engage an architect to prepare preliminary designs adhering to the calculated FSI, ground coverage, and height limits, ensuring compliance with fire safety, structural stability, and other statutory requirements.\n5.  **Environmental and Heritage Clearances:** Given the \"Walled City\" location, assess if any environmental impact assessments or heritage conservation clearances are required prior to development application.\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based solely on the provided text excerpts and user input.
