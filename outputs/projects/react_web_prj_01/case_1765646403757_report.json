Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe development plot is located in the Island City and falls under Residential (R-Zone) zoning. The abutting road width of 20.0 m dictates the maximum permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) entitlements.\n\nBased on the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR-2034) Table 12 for the Island City, a road width between 18.00m and 27m allows for a total permissible FSI of 2.70. This total FSI is composed of the Zonal (Basic) FSI, additional FSI purchasable via premium, and admissible Transferable Development Rights (TDR). The proposed residential use aligns with the R-Zone entitlements analyzed. The calculations below utilize the Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1991.0 sq. m.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **FSI Entitlements:** Page 83, Table 12 (Floor Space Indices in Residential, Commercial and Industrial Zones).\n*   **Premium Calculation Basis (Inferred):** Page 177, DCPR-2034, Regulation for Additional FSI (stipulating 50% of ASR for premium calculation, commonly applied to purchased FSI).\n*   **FSI Exemptions (General):** Page 88, Regulation 31(1) (Exemptions for parking, staircases, lift areas, etc.).\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe entitlements are calculated based on the Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1991.0 sq. m. using the FSI components specified in Table 12 for the 18.00m to < 27m road width category.\n\n| FSI Component | FSI Multiplier | Calculation (1991.0 sq. m. * FSI) | Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. Zonal (Basic) FSI** | 1.33 | 1991.0 * 1.33 | 2648.03 sq. m. |\n| **2. Premium FSI** | 0.73 | 1991.0 * 0.73 | 1453.43 sq. m. |\n| **3. Admissible TDR** | 0.64 | 1991.0 * 0.64 | 1274.24 sq. m. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.70** | 1991.0 * 2.70 | **5375.70 sq. m.** |\n| **Proposed Height** | N/A | Subject to NOCs | 55.0 m. |\n\n**Financial Calculation (Premium FSI Cost):**\n\nThe cost for the Premium FSI (0.73) must be paid to the Municipal Corporation. Assuming the standard DCPR-2034 premium rate of 50% of the Annual Statement Rate (ASR) applies to the purchased BUA:\n\n*   Premium BUA Area: 1453.43 sq. m.\n*   ASR Rate: \u20b990.0 / sq.m.\n*   Premium Cost Formula (Inferred): 0.5 * ASR * Premium BUA Area\n\n$$\n\\text{Premium Cost} = 0.5 \\times \u20b990.0/\\text{sq.m.} \\times 1453.43 \\text{ sq. m.}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{Premium Cost} = \u20b965,404.35\n$$\n\n*(Note: This calculation determines the premium payable for the additional FSI area. The cost of acquiring the TDR FSI (1274.24 sq. m.) is negotiated on the open market and is not calculated here.)*\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile the primary FSI potential is clear from Table 12 (Page 83), the following critical information is missing from the provided context, which impacts the final feasibility of the 55.0 m structure:\n\n1.  **Maximum Permissible Height:** The context does not specify the maximum height cap for R-Zone plots on a 20.0 m road. Height is typically restricted by fire safety norms, structural stability rules, and potentially proximity to airports (which requires AAI NOCs).\n2.  **Setback and Open Space Requirements:** The feasibility of achieving a 55.0 m height depends heavily on the minimum required front, side, and rear setbacks, which dictate the maximum ground coverage and tower footprint. These setback rules are essential for vertical development.\n3.  **Specific Residential Premium Confirmation:** Although the premium rate of 50% of ASR is standard, the direct citation provided (Page 177) relates to IT/ITES units. Confirmation of the exact premium calculation methodology for general Residential Premium FSI under Regulation 30(A)(1) is required.\n4.  **FSI Exemptions Details:** The final usable BUA will be higher than the calculated 5375.70 sq. m. due to FSI exemptions for parking, staircases, and lifts (Page 88, Regulation 31). The exact calculation of these exempted areas must be performed during detailed design.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Verify Height Feasibility:** Immediately consult the full DCPR-2034 (or local municipal authority) to confirm the maximum permissible height for a 20.0 m road in the Island City R-Zone. Simultaneously initiate preliminary inquiries regarding Fire Department and Airport Authority of India (AAI) No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) for the proposed 55.0 m height.\n2.  **Detailed Design & Setbacks:** Obtain the specific setback regulations (DCPR Regulation 27) corresponding to the proposed height (55.0 m) to determine the viable building footprint and ensure the design complies with open space requirements.\n3.  **Budgeting for Entitlements:** Allocate the required budget for the Premium FSI payment (\u20b965,404.35 based on the provided ASR). Note that the actual ASR rate for 2025 will likely be significantly higher than the \u20b990.0/sq.m. provided, drastically increasing the actual premium cost.\n4.  **TDR Acquisition Strategy:** Develop a strategy for acquiring 1274.24 sq. m. of TDR certificates, monitoring the current market rate and availability.\n5.  **Calculate Exempted Area:** Proceed with the architectural planning to calculate the exact area of FSI-exempt components (staircases, lifts, parking floors) to determine the final, total saleable/usable built-up area.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based strictly on the textual excerpts provided from the DCPR-2034 context and the user-defined parameters. Actual development permissions are subject to the full text of the prevailing regulations, detailed architectural plans, specific site conditions, and final approval by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and other relevant statutory authorities. The ASR rate used (\u20b990.0/sq.m.) is based solely on the user input and does not reflect current market values.",
