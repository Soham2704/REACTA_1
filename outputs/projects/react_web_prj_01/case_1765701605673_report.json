        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 14, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n*   **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n*   **Location Type:** Congested Area\n*   **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n*   **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n*   **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n*   **Proposed Height:** 20.0\n*   **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m.\n*   **Deductions:** 9.0 sq. m.\n*   **Net Plot Area:** 1991.0 sq. m.\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b960.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\nThis analysis focuses on the development potential of a 2000 sq. m. plot located in a Congested Area, zoned Residential (R-Zone), with a proposed purely residential building. Based on the provided regulations, the primary rules for congested areas under the DCPR-2018 for PMRDA are applicable.\n\nFor a purely residential building in a congested area, the maximum permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) is 1.50. The front setback for the abutting 20.0 m. road width is 2.00 m. Side and rear open spaces for plots above 1000 sq. m. are referenced to Regulation No. 15, the details of which are not provided in the context. Similarly, the permissible height of the building is governed by Regulation No. 17.8, which is also not detailed in the provided text. No provisions for Premium FSI or Transferable Development Rights (TDR) for purely residential buildings in congested areas are explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **Congested Area Applicability:** \"Regulation 20.0 GENERAL\", \"Page 79\"\n*   **FSI for Residential Building in Congested Area:** \"Regulation 20.1.2 (a) Floor Space Index.\", \"Page 79\"\n*   **Front Setback for Residential Building in Congested Area:** \"Regulation 20.1.2 (b) Marginal Open Spaces/Setback\", \"Page 79\"\n*   **Side & Rear Open Spaces for Residential Building in Congested Area:** \"Regulation 20.1.2 (c) Side & rear open spaces in meter\", \"Page 79\"\n*   **Height Regulations:** \"Regulation 20.1.2 (f) Height\", \"Page 79\"\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\nBased on the Net Plot Area of 1991.0 sq. m.:\n\n| Entitlement Category | Value / Calculation | Notes |\n| :------------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Base FSI**         | 1.50                | Maximum permissible FSI for purely residential building in a congested area. (Regulation 20.1.2(a))                                                          |\n| **Premium FSI**      | 0                   | No explicit provision for Premium FSI for purely residential buildings in congested areas found in the provided context. |\n| **TDR FSI**          | 0                   | No explicit provision for TDR FSI for residential buildings in congested areas found in the provided context.                                                |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **1.50**         | (Base FSI + Premium FSI + TDR FSI)                                                                                                                           |\n| **Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA)** | 2986.50 sq. m. | Net Plot Area (1991.0 sq. m.) * Total Permissible FSI (1.50) |\n| **Permissible Height** | Undetermined        | Governed by Regulation No. 17.8, which is not provided in the context. The proposed height of 20.0 m needs to be verified against this missing regulation. |\n\n**Financials:**\n*   **Premium FSI Cost:** Since Premium FSI is determined to be 0 for purely residential use based on the provided text, the cost calculation for Premium FSI is \u20b90.0.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\nTo provide a complete and definitive analysis, the following critical information is missing from the provided context:\n*   **Details of Regulation No. 15:** This regulation governs the side and rear open spaces for plots exceeding 1000 sq. m. (which includes the subject plot of 2000 sq. m.). Its absence prevents a complete assessment of marginal distances.\n*   **Details of Regulation No. 17.8:** This regulation is explicitly cited as governing the permissible height of buildings. Without it, the proposed building height of 20.0 m. cannot be definitively confirmed as permissible.\n*   **Specific R-Zone Classification (R1 or R2):** While the FSI for \"purely residential building\" is given, the context mentions additional FSI for mixed-use specifically in R-2 zone. Knowing the exact R-zone could reveal further nuances, though for purely residential, the current FSI seems clear.\n*   **Applicability of specific Appendix Regulations:** While the location is defined as \"Congested Area,\" it is not explicitly stated if it falls under specific planning areas such as Kune-Pangaloli-Kurwande (Appendix S) or Lonavala-Karla-Malavali (Appendix R). However, the general \"Regulations for Congested area\" (Regulation 20.1) have been prioritized due to the explicit \"Location Type.\"\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n1.  **Obtain Full Regulations:** Request the complete text for Regulation No. 15 (General Land Development Requirements) and Regulation No. 17.8 (Open Space, Area and Height Limitations) to determine precise marginal open spaces and maximum permissible building height.\n2.  **Confirm Zoning Sub-category:** Verify if the \"Residential (R-Zone)\" is specifically R1 or R2, although this may not impact the FSI for a purely residential building as per current information.\n3.  **Site-Specific Verification:** Conduct a detailed site survey to confirm existing conditions, access, and any other site-specific constraints that might influence development.\n4.  **Consult Local Planning Authority:** Engage directly with the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) to confirm the interpretation of these regulations for the specific plot and to clarify any ambiguities regarding missing regulations or potential additional requirements.\n5.  **Review for Other Applicable Appendices:** Confirm with the planning authority if the plot falls under any specific regional planning area appendices (like S or R) that might supersede or add to the general congested area regulations.\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based solely on the provided text excerpts and user query parameters. It does not constitute legal advice or a final planning approval. Final development permissions are subject to the comprehensive review and approval of the relevant municipal planning authorities, including all applicable regulations, site-specific conditions, and any subsequent amendments to the development control regulations. Users are strongly advised to consult with professional architects, urban planners, and the local planning department for definitive guidance.",
