        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 13, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Island City\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 30.0 m.\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m. sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 5.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 1995.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe Net Plot Area of 1995.0 sq. m. falls within the standard residential plot size category of \"Above 500 - 2000 sq. m.\" According to the retrieved development control table, specific limitations on Floor Area Ratio (FAR), Ground Coverage (GC), and height are applicable for this segment.\n\nThe key finding is that the proposed height of 30.0 m significantly exceeds the standard limit for this plot size category. While general rules mention \"No Restriction\" on height subject to statutory clearances (AAI, Fire Services), the specific table governing plot size dictates a strict limit. Furthermore, the context does not provide specific regulations for calculating Premium FSI or TDR based on the 20.0 m road width for standard residential plots, thus the calculation relies solely on the Base FSI.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   Development Controls (Ground Coverage, FAR, Height for 500-2000 sq. m. plot): Page 90, Table entry \"Above 500 - 2000\".\n*   General Height Rule (No Restriction, subject to clearance): Page 118, Clause iii.\n*   Parking Standards for Residential Use: Page 275, Table 17.2, Sl. No. 1.\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nBased on the Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1995.0 sq. m., the applicable development controls are:\n\n1.  **Maximum Ground Coverage (GC):** 60% (Page 90)\n2.  **Maximum Base FAR/FSI:** 120% or 1.20 (Page 90)\n3.  **Maximum Permissible Height:** Below 15m (Page 90)\n\n| Metric | Calculation | Value | Unit |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Net Plot Area (NPA)** | 2000.0 - 5.0 | 1995.0 | sq. m. |\n| **Base FSI** | Standard for 500-2000 sqm plot | 1.20 | Ratio |\n| **Premium FSI** | (Not specified in context for this category) | 0.00 | Ratio |\n| **TDR FSI** | (Not specified in context) | 0.00 | Ratio |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | Base FSI + Premium FSI + TDR FSI | 1.20 | Ratio |\n| **Maximum Permissible BUA** | NPA * Total FSI (1995.0 * 1.20) | 2394.0 | sq. m. |\n| **Maximum Footprint (GC)** | NPA * 60% (1995.0 * 0.60) | 1197.0 | sq. m. |\n| **Maximum Permissible Height** | As per standard control table | 15.0 | m |\n| **Required ECS (Parking)** | BUA / 100 * 2.0 (2394.0 / 100 * 2.0) | 47.88 (~48) | Spaces |\n\n**Financial Calculation (Premium FSI Charges):**\n\nSince no Premium FSI is identified or calculable based on the provided context for this R-Zone category, the premium cost is zero.\n\n*   Premium FSI Area = 0.0 sq. m.\n*   ASR Rate = \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n*   Cost of Premium FSI = 0.5 * ASR * Premium FSI Area\n*   **Cost of Premium FSI = \u20b90.00**\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nThe analysis is constrained by several critical missing regulatory details pertinent to modern municipal development:\n\n1.  **Premium FSI/Road Width Matrix:** The context lacks a table or rule specifying how the 20.0 m road width (ROW) allows for enhanced FSI (Premium FSI) in standard Residential (R-Zone) plots. Without this, it is impossible to determine the maximum achievable FSI beyond the base 1.20.\n2.  **TDR Entitlement Rules:** There are no explicit rules defining the availability, calculation, or utilization of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) for residential plots of this size.\n3.  **Specific R-Zone Sub-Classification:** The general designation \"Residential (R-Zone)\" is used, but the context does not specify if this plot falls under a specific sub-classification (e.g., LIG, MIG, Group Housing, etc.) which might unlock different development controls (e.g., higher FARs or heights, as seen in the Police Personnel Housing example on Page 200).\n4.  **Height Relaxation Criteria:** Although the proposed height (30.0 m) exceeds the 15.0 m limit (Page 90), the exact criteria required to invoke the general \"No Restriction\" rule (Page 118) and obtain clearances from AAI and Fire Services are not detailed.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Height Compliance Review:** The user must immediately review the proposed 30.0 m height against the strict 15.0 m limit specified for the 500-2000 sq. m. plot category. If the higher limit is desired, specific justification and approval from the Technical Committee (as noted in general rules) and statutory bodies (AAI/Fire Services) will be mandatory.\n2.  **Local Body Consultation on FSI Enhancement:** Engage with the concerned local planning body to determine the applicable Premium FSI rates and calculation methodology based on the 20.0 m road width. This is crucial for maximizing the BUA potential beyond 2394.0 sq. m.\n3.  **Detailed Parking Strategy:** Plan for the required 48 ECS (Equivalent Car Spaces). Since the plot area (1995.0 sq. m.) is above 300 sq. m., provision for parking and loading/unloading must be made by the owner within the plot (Page 90, Note 4), likely utilizing basements.\n4.  **Fire Safety and Development Code Compliance:** Ensure the design conforms to fire safety norms (as per UBBL 2016) and Chapter 17.0 Development Code stipulations regarding setbacks, services plans, and basement usage (Page 118, Clause vi).\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based solely on the provided text excerpts (MPD-2021 modified up to 31/12/2020).
