Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe proposed residential development falls within the Island City jurisdiction, zoned Residential (R-Zone), abutting a 20.0 m wide road. Based on the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034) for the Island City, the plot is eligible for a total permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) of 2.70.\n\nThis total FSI is composed of the Zonal (Basic) FSI, Premium FSI (requiring payment), and permissible Transferable Development Rights (TDR). The 20.0 m road width places the plot in the category of \"18.00m & above but less than 27m\" road width, maximizing the entitlement structure for this plot size and location.\n\nThe calculation of the premium for the additional FSI (0.73) is based on 50% of the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR) applied to the utilized premium built-up area (BUA).\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **FSI Entitlements (Island City, 18m-27m Road):** Page 83, Table 12, Sr. No. I, Row 4.\n*   **Premium FSI Charging Mechanism (General/Inferred):** Page 177, DCPR-2034, PART VI (Condition a).\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe calculations for the maximum permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) and the associated financial premium are based on the **Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1990.0 sq. m.**\n\n| FSI Component | FSI Rate (DCPR-2034) | Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) (sq. m.) | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Zonal (Basic) FSI** | 1.33 | 2646.7 | Mandatorily available. |\n| **Premium FSI** | 0.73 | 1452.7 | Requires payment of premium. |\n| **Admissible TDR FSI** | 0.64 | 1273.6 | Requires purchase/utilization of TDR certificates. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.70** | **5373.0** | Maximum potential development. |\n| **Permissible Height** | N/A | N/A | Proposed 15.0 m is likely permissible, subject to fire NOC and airport/coastal zone restrictions (not provided). |\n\n**Financial Calculation for Premium FSI:**\n\nThe premium is calculated for the Additional FSI (0.73) utilized, corresponding to 1452.7 sq. m. of BUA.\n\n*   **Premium FSI Area:** 1452.7 sq. m.\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n*   **Premium Rate:** 50% of ASR (0.5)\n*   **Premium Cost Formula:** $Cost = 0.5 \\times ASR \\times Premium\\_FSI\\_Area$\n*   **Premium Cost:** $0.5 \\times \u20b990.0/sq.m. \\times 1452.7 sq. m.$\n*   **Total Estimated Premium Cost:** **\u20b965,371.50**\n\n*(Note: This cost represents the base land value component of the premium charge. Additional fees, taxes, and development charges are not included.)*\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile the FSI entitlement calculation is robust based on the provided Table 12, the following critical information is missing or requires further verification:\n\n1.  **Specific Height Restrictions:** The proposed height (15.0 m) is generally low but needs verification against specific regulations concerning the maximum permissible height in the R-Zone, especially considering potential proximity to airports (Aviation limits) or coastal zones (CRZ limits).\n2.  **Exempted Areas Confirmation:** The analysis assumes the 5373.0 sq. m. BUA is the FSI-consumptive area. The context provides several exemptions (Page 88, Regulation 31), such as stilt/basement parking, staircase/lift wells (with premium), and specific features in open spaces. A detailed design would require confirming which areas (e.g., parking, refuge floors) can be excluded from the 5373.0 sq. m. calculation.\n3.  **Mandatory Open Space Requirements:** The required setbacks and minimum mandatory open spaces for a plot of 2000 sq. m. are not provided, which directly affects the achievable footprint and practical layout of the 15.0 m building.\n4.  **TDR Availability & Cost:** The calculation assumes the developer will utilize the maximum admissible TDR (0.64 FSI). The actual availability and market cost of TDR certificates are external factors crucial for project feasibility.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on this preliminary analysis, the consultant recommends the following actionable steps:\n\n1.  **Detailed Design Confirmation:** Initiate schematic design to determine the exact areas required for staircases, lifts, and parking. Use Regulation 31 (Page 88) to maximize FSI exemptions (e.g., claiming free FSI for covered parking and staircases/lifts with premium, where applicable).\n2.  **Verify Height Compliance:** Confirm the proposed 15.0 m height is compliant with the maximum permissible height for the specific R-Zone sector and obtain necessary No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) from the Fire Department and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) if applicable.\n3.  **Budgeting for Premium & TDR:** Finalize the financial budget for the project, including the estimated premium payment (\u20b965,371.50) for the additional FSI and the projected cost for acquiring the required TDR certificates (1273.6 sq. m. BUA equivalent).\n4.  **Confirm Deductions:** Verify the reason and documentation for the 10.0 sq. m. deduction to ensure the Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1990.0 sq. m. is officially recognized by the Planning Authority for FSI calculation, as FSI is calculated on the net area excluding handed over land (Page 177).\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis of the provided regulatory excerpts and user input parameters.
