        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 14, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n*   **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n*   **Location Type:** Island City\n*   **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n*   **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n*   **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n*   **Proposed Height:** 15.0 m.\n*   **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m.\n*   **Deductions:** 9.0 sq. m.\n*   **Net Plot Area:** 1991.0 sq. m.\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b920.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\nBased on the provided regulations, the proposed Residential Building on a 1991.0 sq. m. net plot area in an Island City Residential Zone with a 20.0 m abutting road width is primarily governed by the Floor Space Index (FSI) provisions for such zones. The regulations permit a maximum permissible FSI, which is a combination of Zonal (Basic) FSI, Additional FSI on payment of Premium, and Admissible Transferable Development Rights (TDR). For the specified road width, the applicable FSI components lead to a total permissible FSI of 2.7. The premium for additional FSI is typically calculated as a percentage of the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR) for the additional built-up area. The context does not provide specific general height restrictions for residential buildings in this zone.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   Floor Space Indices in Residential, Commercial and Industrial Zones: Page 83, TABLE 12, Regulation 30(A)1\n*   Premium calculation for additional FSI (inferred from IT/ITES section as general guideline): Page 177, Regulation a) under DCPR-2034 PART VI ADDITIONAL FLOOR SPACE INDEX\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\nUsing the rules from the context and the Net Plot Area of 1991.0 sq. m.:\n\n| Entitlement Type          | FSI Value | Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) (sq. m.) |\n| :------------------------ | :-------- | :--------------------------------------- |\n| Zonal (Basic) FSI         | 1.33      | 2648.03                                  |\n| Premium FSI               | 0.73      | 1453.43                                  |\n| Admissible TDR            | 0.64      | 1274.24                                  |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.70**  | **5375.70**                              |\n\n**Financials (Premium FSI Cost):**\nThe premium for the additional FSI is calculated based on 50% of the ASR rate for the built-up area.\n*   Premium FSI Area = 1453.43 sq. m.\n*   ASR Rate = \u20b920.0/sq.m.\n*   Cost of Premium FSI = 0.5 * ASR Rate * Premium FSI Area\n*   Cost of Premium FSI = 0.5 * \u20b920.0/sq.m. * 1453.43 sq.m. = **\u20b914,534.30**\n\n**Permissible Height:**\nThe provided context does not specify a general maximum permissible height for Residential (R-Zone) developments in Island City. The proposed height of 15.0 m needs to be verified against general development control regulations not present in this excerpt.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\nWhile a comprehensive analysis has been performed based on the provided context, the following critical information is missing from the regulations excerpt:\n*   **General Height Restrictions:** Specific maximum permissible building height for Residential (R-Zone) in Island City is not provided, making it impossible to confirm if the proposed height of 15.0 m is compliant.\n*   **Specific Premium FSI Calculation for Residential:** Although an inference was made from the IT/ITES section regarding the 50% ASR rate for premium FSI, a specific regulation detailing premium calculation for general residential additional FSI would provide greater certainty.\n*   **Setback and Open Space Requirements:** Regulations pertaining to front, side, and rear setbacks, as well as mandatory open spaces around the building, are not included in the provided text. These are crucial for determining the buildable footprint.\n*   **Parking Requirements:** While some exemptions related to parking areas are mentioned, the general parking requirements for a residential building of this scale are absent.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n1.  **Verify Height Regulations:** Immediately consult the full Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034) or the local planning authority to ascertain the maximum permissible building height for Residential Zones in Island City.\n2.  **Confirm Premium FSI Calculation:** Seek clarification from the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) regarding the exact methodology and applicable rates for calculating premium for additional FSI in residential developments.\n3.  **Obtain Full Regulations:** Acquire the complete DCPR-2034 document to understand all relevant regulations, including those pertaining to setbacks, mandatory open spaces, ground coverage, and parking requirements, which will impact the final design and approvals.\n4.  **Preliminary Design Review:** Once all relevant regulations are gathered, conduct a preliminary architectural design review to ensure compliance with all FSI, height, setback, and parking requirements.\n5.  **Pre-Application Consultation:** Consider a pre-application meeting with the MCGM planning department to discuss the proposed development and clarify any ambiguities in the regulations.\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis generated by an AI consultant based solely on the provided text excerpts and user query parameters.
