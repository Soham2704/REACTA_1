Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe subject plot is located in the Island City, designated as a Residential (R) Zone, and abuts a 20.0 m wide road. Based on the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034), the plot falls into the highest category of FSI entitlement for the Island City, short of the 27m road width category.\n\nThe analysis utilizes **Table 12** of the DCPR-2034, which defines the maximum permissible FSI components for Residential/Commercial Zones in the Island City. Since the road width (20.0 m) falls within the range of \"18.00m & above but less than 27m,\" the maximum permissible FSI is capped at 2.70, consisting of Zonal (Basic) FSI, Premium FSI, and Admissible TDR.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   Floor Space Indices in Residential, Commercial and Industrial Zones: **Page 83, TABLE 12**\n*   Definition of Additional FSI on payment of Premium (General Principle): **Page 83, TABLE 12**\n*   Premium Cost Calculation Methodology (Inferred from similar regulations): **Page 177, DCPR-2034 (a)**\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe FSI calculations are based on the **Net Plot Area (NPA)** of 1991.0 sq. m.\n\nThe applicable FSI components for a 20.0 m road width in Island City (R-Zone) are:\n*   Zonal (Basic) FSI: 1.33\n*   Additional FSI on payment of Premium: 0.73\n*   Admissible TDR: 0.64\n*   Total Permissible FSI: 2.70\n\n| Component | FSI Rate | Calculation (1991.0 sq. m.) | Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Zonal (Basic) FSI** | 1.33 | 1991.0 * 1.33 | 2648.03 sq. m. |\n| **Premium FSI** | 0.73 | 1991.0 * 0.73 | 1453.43 sq. m. |\n| **Admissible TDR** | 0.64 | 1991.0 * 0.64 | 1274.24 sq. m. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.70** | 1991.0 * 2.70 | **5375.70 sq. m.** |\n\n**Premium Financial Calculation (Cost for Premium FSI):**\n\nThe premium for the Additional FSI (0.73) is calculated based on the standard municipal guideline of 50% of the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR) applied to the premium BUA.\n\n*   Premium FSI Area (BUA): 1453.43 sq. m.\n*   ASR Rate: \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n*   Formula: Cost = 0.5 * ASR * Premium\\_FSI\\_Area\n\n$$\n\\text{Premium Cost} = 0.5 \\times \u20b990.0/\\text{sq.m.} \\times 1453.43 \\text{ sq. m.}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{Premium Cost} = \u20b945.0/\\text{sq.m.} \\times 1453.43 \\text{ sq. m.}\n$$\n\n**Total Premium Payable = \u20b965,404.35**\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile the FSI calculation is definitive based on the provided table, several critical operational and regulatory details necessary for a complete project planning assessment are absent from the context:\n\n1.  **Maximum Permissible Height:** The context does not specify the maximum allowable building height (in meters or number of floors) for Residential Zones in the Island City with a 20.0 m road width. The proposed height of 15.0 m must be checked against this limit, as well as fire safety regulations and proximity to airports/defense establishments.\n2.  **Setback and Marginal Open Space Requirements:** Regulations governing mandatory front, side, and rear open spaces are necessary to determine the maximum developable footprint (ground coverage). These requirements directly impact the practical feasibility of achieving the maximum BUA entitlement.\n3.  **Specific Residential Premium Calculation Formula:** Although the standard 50% ASR rate was applied (inferred from Page 177), the context does not provide the explicit, confirmed calculation formula for the \"Additional FSI on payment of Premium\" listed in Table 12 for Residential Zones.\n4.  **TDR Acquisition Cost:** The cost associated with acquiring the 1274.24 sq. m. of TDR BUA is market-driven and not provided by the regulations.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Verify Height and Setbacks:** Immediately consult the full DCPR-2034 (beyond the provided excerpts) to confirm the maximum permissible height and the mandatory marginal open space requirements for the R-Zone on a 20.0 m road. This determines the buildable envelope.\n2.  **Confirm Premium Calculation:** Officially verify the exact premium calculation methodology with the Municipal Corporation Planning Authority to confirm the use of 50% of the ASR for the Premium FSI (0.73).\n3.  **TDR Strategy:** Initiate market research to estimate the cost and availability of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) required to utilize the full 0.64 FSI potential (1274.24 sq. m. BUA).\n4.  **Parking and Exemptions:** Review Regulation 31 (Page 88) to maximize FSI exemptions (e.g., parking, staircase areas, lift wells) to ensure the maximum permissible built-up area of 5375.70 sq. m. is utilized for saleable residential area.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided text excerpts from the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034). The information regarding FSI is based on specific tables and rules found in the context. Practical development is subject to full regulatory compliance, including fire safety, height restrictions, and specific interpretations by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM).",
