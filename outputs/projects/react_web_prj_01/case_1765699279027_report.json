Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe subject property is a large plot (1881.0 sq. m. net) located in a Developing Area, abutting a major road (23.0 m width). Given the size of the plot (greater than 0.40 Hect. / 4000 sq. m. is generally the threshold for non-congested area rules, but 1881 sq. m. is significantly above the 1000 sq. m. limit for congested area exceptions) and the nature of a \"Developing Area,\" the regulations for **Outside Congested Area** (Non-Congested Area) as stipulated in Part IV of the DCPR-2018 for PMRDA are applicable.\n\nThe proposed building height (15.0 m) falls within the category governed by specific setback rules for residential buildings of 15 m and below. Development potential (FSI) for residential use in the R-Zone is determined primarily by the width of the abutting road (23.0 m).\n\n**Key Findings based on available context:**\n\n1.  **Applicable Zone:** The analysis defaults to **Regulations for Outside Congested Area** (Non-Congested Area).\n2.  **Height & Setbacks:** The proposed height (15.0 m) requires adherence to specific marginal distance rules for buildings 15 m and below (though the specific table is missing).\n3.  **FSI Entitlement:** FSI is determined by Regulation 20.3, which allows for a Basic FSI and potentially an Additional/Premium FSI, based on the road width (23.0 m). *However, the specific table linking the 23.0 m road width to the Base FSI and the Maximum Building Potential is not present in the provided excerpts.*\n\n**Citations:**\n*   Regulations for Outside Congested Area: Rule 20.2 (Page 80)\n*   Marginal Distances (Height 15m and below): Rule 20.2.1 (Page 80)\n*   Permissible FSI: Rule 20.3 (Page 84)\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nSince the specific tables for Base FSI based on road width (23.0 m) are missing, the following calculations are based on the common assumption for a major road in a developing R-Zone under DCPR: **Base FSI = 1.00** and **Maximum FSI Potential (including Premium FSI) = 2.00**.\n\n**Net Plot Area (NPA):** 1881.0 sq. m.\n\n| Entitlement Type | FSI Ratio (Assumed) | Calculation (NPA = 1881.0 sq. m.) | Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Base FSI** | 1.00 | $1.00 \\times 1881.0$ | 1881.0 sq. m. |\n| **Premium FSI** | 1.00 | $1.00 \\times 1881.0$ | 1881.0 sq. m. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.00** | $2.00 \\times 1881.0$ | **3762.0 sq. m.** |\n| **Permissible Height** | N/A | Governed by Rule 20.2.1 and 17.8 | 15.0 m (Proposed, likely permissible) |\n\n---\n**Financial Analysis: Premium FSI Cost**\n\nThe Premium FSI area (1881.0 sq. m.) must be purchased at 50% of the Annual Schedule of Rates (ASR) for the land.\n\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0 per sq. m.\n*   **Premium FSI Area (Assumed):** 1881.0 sq. m.\n\n$$\n\\text{Premium Cost} = 0.5 \\times \\text{ASR Rate} \\times \\text{Premium FSI Area}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Premium Cost} = 0.5 \\times \u20b990.0/\\text{sq.m.} \\times 1881.0 \\text{ sq. m.}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Premium Cost} = \u20b945.0 \\times 1881.0\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{Total\\ Premium\\ Cost} = \\mathbf{\u20b984,645.00}\n$$\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nThe analysis relies on critical assumptions due to the incomplete nature of the provided regulatory excerpts. The following specific data points are missing:\n\n1.  **Base FSI Table:** The table governing the permissible **Basic FSI** for R-Zone based on road width (23.0 m) in the non-congested area (referenced implicitly by Rule 20.3) is absent. *The analysis assumes a Base FSI of 1.00.*\n2.  **Maximum Building Potential (Total FSI):** The maximum FSI (Basic + Premium) allowed for a 23.0 m road width is not explicitly stated. *The analysis assumes a total FSI cap of 2.00.*\n3.  **Marginal Distance/Setback Table:** The specific table detailing the required marginal open spaces (front, side, and rear setbacks) for buildings up to 15.0 m in height in a non-congested area (Rule 20.2.1) is missing. These setbacks are crucial for determining the maximum ground coverage.\n4.  **Specific R-Zone Classification:** The R-Zone is generic. Knowing if it is R-1 (less intensive) or R-2 (more intensive, mixed-use potential) would confirm the applicability of the FSI and use rules. (The analysis assumes standard residential R-Zone rules for non-congested areas.)\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on the preliminary analysis, the user should proceed with the following actionable steps:\n\n1.  **Obtain Detailed FSI Table:** Immediately source the complete DCPR-2018 table (likely linked to Regulation 20.3) that correlates the 23.0 m road width to the precise Basic FSI and Maximum Permissible FSI for the R-Zone. This will confirm the Total BUA (3762.0 sq. m. assumed here).\n2.  **Verify Setback Requirements:** Obtain the complete table for marginal distances (Rule 20.2.1) to accurately determine the required front, side, and rear setbacks for the 15.0 m height building. This is essential for architectural planning and calculating the maximum ground coverage.\n3.  **Confirm Zoning Sub-Classification:** Verify whether the plot falls under R-1 or R-2 zoning, as R-2 permits additional FSI (up to 0.5) for mixed-use commercial elements if desired (Rule 20.1.2(a) provides an example for congested areas, but similar rules often apply to R-2 in non-congested areas).\n4.  **Budget Confirmation:** Allocate the calculated minimum premium cost of \u20b984,645.00 (based on assumed FSI) for government fees required to utilize the Premium FSI entitlement.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided textual excerpts of the municipal development regulations (DCPR-2018 for PMRDA) and the parameters supplied by the user. Due to missing critical regulatory tables (specifically those detailing FSI entitlements and mandatory setbacks based on road width), several key figures are based on standard professional assumptions for similar jurisdictions. Final entitlement confirmation requires consultation with the full, officially enacted Development Control and Promotion Regulations.",
