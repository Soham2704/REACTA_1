Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe proposed development is located in the Island City in a Residential (R) Zone, abutting a 20.0 m wide road. Based on the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR-2034) for the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, the FSI entitlement is determined by the specific road width category defined in Table 12.\n\nThe 20.0 m road width falls into the category of \"18.00m & above but less than 27m.\" This category permits a maximum total FSI of 2.70, which is composed of Basic Zonal FSI, Premium FSI (purchasable), and Transferable Development Rights (TDR). The total permissible FSI of 2.70 is within the general maximum cap of 3.00 specified for plots up to 2000 sq. m. (as referenced in the context regarding incentive schemes, which often define the maximum ceiling).\n\n**Citations:**\n*   FSI Entitlements (Basic, Premium, TDR, Total): Page 83, Table 12 (Sr No. I, Road width 18.00m & above but less than 27m).\n*   FSI Exemptions (Staircase, Parking): Page 88, Regulation 31.\n*   Premium Calculation Methodology Inference (50% ASR): Page 177, (a) (Inferred from IT/ITES regulation methodology, commonly applied to other Premium FSI).\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe calculations below are based on the **Net Plot Area (NPA)** of 1991.0 sq. m.\n\n| FSI Component | Applicable FSI Rate | Calculation (Rate * 1991.0 sq. m.) | Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Base Zonal FSI** | 1.33 | 1.33 * 1991.0 | 2648.03 sq. m. |\n| **Premium FSI** | 0.73 | 0.73 * 1991.0 | 1453.43 sq. m. |\n| **Admissible TDR FSI** | 0.64 | 0.64 * 1991.0 | 1274.24 sq. m. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.70** | **2.70 * 1991.0** | **5375.70 sq. m.** |\n\n**Financial Calculation (Premium FSI Cost):**\n\nThe premium cost for the additional FSI (0.73) is calculated based on the area utilized, typically at 50% of the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR).\n\n*   Area subject to Premium: 1453.43 sq. m.\n*   ASR Rate: \u20b960.0/sq.m.\n*   Formula: Cost = 0.5 * ASR Rate * Premium BUA Area\n*   Cost = 0.5 * \u20b960.0/sq.m. * 1453.43 sq. m.\n*   **Total Premium Cost (Estimated):** **\u20b943,602.90**\n\n**Permissible Height:**\nThe context does not specify the maximum permissible height for a Residential Building on a 20.0 m road in the Island City. The proposed height of 15.0 m is likely acceptable, but must be verified against specific height regulations (which are often governed by road width, airport restrictions, and fire safety norms, none of which are detailed in the provided excerpts).\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile the FSI entitlement can be definitively established from the context, several critical elements necessary for final development approval are missing:\n\n1.  **Maximum Permissible Height:** The specific regulation governing the maximum permissible building height (in meters or number of floors) for a residential structure on a 20.0 m road in the R-Zone is not provided.\n2.  **TDR Cost and Availability:** While 0.64 FSI is admissible as TDR, the calculation assumes TDR is available and does not include the financial cost of purchasing the TDR certificates, as TDR rates are market-driven and not fixed by the ASR premium formula.\n3.  **Specific Residential Premium Rules:** The premium calculation relies on a formula inferred from the IT/ITES section (Page 177). While this 50% ASR rule is standard practice, confirmation that this exact formula applies to purchased FSI in the Residential Zone is required.\n4.  **Open Space and Setback Requirements:** The context lacks details on mandatory front, side, and rear setbacks, and mandatory open spaces, which govern the buildable footprint (ground coverage) and overall feasibility of the 15.0 m height.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on this preliminary analysis, the user should proceed with the following actionable steps:\n\n1.  **Verify Height Restriction:** Immediately consult the relevant DCPR-2034 regulations regarding maximum permissible height (Regulation 19 or related sections) for the 20.0 m road width and 15.0 m proposed height to ensure compliance.\n2.  **Confirm TDR Strategy:** Determine the current market rate for TDR in the relevant zone and confirm the availability of 1274.24 sq. m. of TDR required to achieve the maximum 2.7 FSI potential.\n3.  **Formal Planning Submission:** Prepare a preliminary architectural plan incorporating the calculated BUA (5375.70 sq. m.) and submit a pre-application query to the Municipal Planning Authority to confirm the exact premium calculation methodology for the R-Zone.\n4.  **Detailed Site Analysis:** Conduct a detailed analysis of the plot geometry against mandatory setback and open space regulations (typically Regulation 40 onwards) to ensure the calculated BUA can be physically accommodated on the 1991.0 sq. m. Net Plot Area.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis of the provided regulatory excerpts (DCPR-2034) and user parameters. It does not constitute final legal or planning approval. All calculations regarding FSI, BUA, and premium costs are estimates based on the cited regulations and must be verified by the relevant Municipal Planning Authority before project implementation. The ASR rate used (\u20b960.0/sq.m.) is exceptionally low and should be confirmed against the official Annual Statement of Rates for the specific plot location and year of approval.",
