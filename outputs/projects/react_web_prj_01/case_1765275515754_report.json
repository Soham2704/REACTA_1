Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe proposed development of a hospital in a Commercial (C-Zone) on a plot exceeding 2000 sq. m. in the Island City is subject to the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR-2034) maximum FSI caps.\n\nBased on the **Net Plot Area of 2194.0 sq. m.**, the overall maximum permissible Floor Space Index (FSI), including all incentives and premium FSI, is capped at **4.00**. The plot size (Above 2000 sq. m.) and the road width (18.0 m) both support this maximum entitlement, although the context does not provide the specific Zonal (Base) FSI for a Hospital use in a C-Zone.\n\nFor the purpose of entitlement calculation, we **infer** a standard Base FSI of 3.00, allowing for 1.00 FSI to be acquired via premium payment up to the 4.00 cap. The premium cost calculation is based on the general methodology found in the regulations for acquiring additional FSI (50% of the Annual Statement Rate or ASR).\n\n**Citations:**\n* **Maximum FSI Cap (> 2000 sq. m.):** Page 182, Clause VII (\"Maximum permissible FSI: 4.00\").\n* **Road Width Requirement:** Page 177, Sr No. 2 (18m road width supports high FSI, up to 4.0 in the specialized IT/ITES section, supporting the general viability of the cap).\n* **Premium FSI Calculation Rate:** Page 177, Clause a (Premium recovered at 50% of ASR for open developed land for BUA).\n* **FSI Exemptions (General):** Page 88, Regulation 31(1) (Staircases, lifts, parking areas may be exempt from FSI calculation, often subject to premium).\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1. **Base FSI (Zonal):** Assumed 3.00 (Specific Zonal FSI for Hospital in C-Zone is missing).\n2. **Maximum Cap:** 4.00 (Based on plot area > 2000 sq. m.).\n3. **TDR:** Not calculated, as the maximum FSI is achievable through Premium FSI up to the cap.\n\n| Entitlement Component | FSI Rate | Calculation (Net Plot Area: 2194.0 sq. m.) | Built-Up Area (BUA) (sq. m.) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. Base (Zonal) FSI** (Assumed) | 3.00 | 2194.0 sq. m. * 3.00 | 6582.0 |\n| **2. Premium FSI** (Up to Cap) | 1.00 | 2194.0 sq. m. * 1.00 | 2194.0 |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** (Cap) | **4.00** | 2194.0 sq. m. * 4.00 | **8776.0** |\n\n**Permissible Height:**\nThe proposed height of 20.0 m is generally acceptable for a commercial building. However, specific height restrictions (e.g., airport funnels, fire safety codes for high-rise buildings) must be confirmed. The context mentions general restrictions on development in certain areas (Page 259, Regulation 45), but no specific height limit is provided for this zone.\n\n**Financial Calculation (Premium FSI Cost):**\n\nThe premium cost for the 1.00 Premium FSI (2194.0 sq. m. BUA) is calculated using the inferred rate of 50% of the ASR (\u20b990.0/sq.m.) for open developed land.\n\n$$\n\\text{Premium Cost} = 0.5 \\times \\text{ASR Rate} \\times \\text{Premium BUA Area}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Premium Cost} = 0.5 \\times \u20b990.0/\\text{sq.m.} \\times 2194.0 \\text{ sq. m.}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Premium Cost} = \u20b945.0 \\times 2194.0 \\text{ sq. m.}\n$$\n$$\n\\textbf{Total Premium Cost} = \\textbf{\u20b998,730.00}\n$$\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nThe analysis is based on general caps and inferred regulatory mechanisms due to the following critical missing data points in the provided context:\n\n1.  **Specific Zonal (Base) FSI:** The exact base FSI for a Hospital use in the Commercial (C-Zone) of the Island City under DCPR-2034 is not defined. We used an inferred value (3.00) to meet the maximum cap (4.00).\n2.  **Specific Hospital Regulations:** Regulations regarding mandatory reservations, required open spaces, or specific parking norms for hospitals are not present. Hospitals are often categorized as special buildings requiring specific setbacks and Fire Officer approvals (Page 259, 44(6)(b)(v)).\n3.  **General Premium FSI Regulation:** While the context provides premium formulas for specialized uses (IT/ITES, PPL), the specific regulation governing the acquisition of general commercial Premium FSI (likely Regulation 30(A)(1) referenced on Page 177) is not detailed.\n4.  **TDR Applicability:** The context does not specify if Transferable Development Rights (TDR) can be utilized in this zone, or if Premium FSI is the only mechanism to reach the 4.00 cap.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Confirm Base FSI:** Immediately verify the specific Base FSI entitlement for a Hospital in the C-Zone of the Island City under DCPR-2034 to validate the assumed 3.00 FSI.\n2.  **Verify Regulatory Approvals:** Initiate preliminary consultations with the Planning Authority regarding the proposed hospital use, as specialized uses often require additional clearances beyond standard commercial development (e.g., Fire Department, Health Department).\n3.  **Detail Parking Requirements:** Calculate the mandatory parking requirements for a hospital of 8776.0 sq. m. BUA. Note that parking areas may be excluded from FSI computation (Page 88, Regulation 31(1)(v), (vi)), but must adhere to required dimensions and open space rules (Page 259).\n4.  **Confirm ASR Interpretation:** Given the extremely low ASR provided (\u20b990.0/sq.m.), confirm that this rate is the correct value to be used for calculating the premium for additional FSI, as ASR values for Island City are typically significantly higher.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based solely on the provided context excerpts and user parameters. It does not constitute final legal or planning approval. All calculations and interpretations regarding FSI, BUA, and financial obligations must be verified with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai Planning Authority before initiating development.",
