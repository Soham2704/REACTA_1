        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 09, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 1900 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Island City\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 21.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 23.0 m.\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 1900 sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 6.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 1894.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b969.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe provided context does not contain the specific Zonal (Base) FSI table for a standard Residential (R-Zone) development in the Island City under DCPR-2034. Therefore, a definitive calculation of the Base FSI entitlement based on the 21.0 m road width cannot be performed.\n\nHowever, based on the general limits mentioned in the regulations pertaining to incentive FSI schemes (which often reference the overall FSI cap), the maximum permissible FSI for a plot size up to 2000 sq. m. is capped at 3.00. We will use this figure (3.00) as the likely total maximum entitlement for the calculation of potential Built-Up Area (BUA).\n\nFurthermore, the proposal may benefit from several FSI exemptions, including areas used for parking, staircases, and lift wells, subject to conditions and, in some cases, the payment of a premium.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   Maximum Permissible FSI Cap (for plots up to 2000 sq. m.): Rule 182, Clause VII.\n*   Exemption of Areas from FSI (Staircases, Lift Wells, Parking): Rule 88, Regulation 31(1).\n*   Premium Basis for Additional FSI/Exemptions: Rule 177, Clause (a) (General principle of 50% ASR usage).\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe analysis proceeds by assuming the maximum achievable FSI for a plot of 1900 sq. m. is 3.00, based on the documented overall FSI cap for plots up to 2000 sq. m.\n\n| Parameter | Calculation / Value | Units | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Net Plot Area (NPA)** | 1894.0 | sq. m. | Gross Area (1900) - Deductions (6.0) |\n| **Base FSI (Zonal)** | *Undetermined* | Ratio | Specific R-Zone table missing in context. |\n| **Maximum Achievable FSI** | 3.00 | Ratio | Inferred cap for plots < 2000 sq. m. |\n| **Maximum Permissible BUA** | 5682.0 | sq. m. | 1894.0 sq. m. * 3.00 FSI |\n| **Proposed Height** | 23.0 | m. | Assumed permissible, subject to relevant NOCs. |\n| **FSI Exemptions Potential** | Applicable | N/A | Staircases, lifts, and required parking areas may be excluded (Reg. 31). |\n\n**Financial Analysis (Premium FSI Cost):**\n\nThe specific quantum of Premium FSI required to reach the 3.00 FSI cap for a standard residential project is unknown, as the Base FSI is missing.\n\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b969.0/sq.m.\n*   **Premium FSI Calculation (Standard Formula):** Cost = 0.5 * ASR * Premium FSI Area.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the required Premium FSI Area cannot be determined, the development premium cost cannot be calculated at this time.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nThe primary limitation of this analysis is the absence of the core zoning schedule for Residential (R-Zone) developments.\n\n1.  **Residential Zonal FSI Table:** The context lacks the specific table detailing the Base FSI permitted for a Residential (R-Zone) development in the Island City based on the 21.0 m road width. This is essential for accurately determining the split between Base FSI, Premium FSI, and Transferable Development Rights (TDR) required to reach the maximum permissible FSI of 3.00.\n2.  **Specific Height Restrictions:** While the proposed height (23.0 m) is noted, the context does not provide the specific height limitations (in meters or floors) applicable to the R-Zone in the Island City, which may override the proposal.\n3.  **Parking Requirements (Regulation 44):** The context references Regulation 44 for parking requirements (Rule 190, Clause iii), but the actual detailed parking matrix for residential use is missing, which is critical for determining the required parking area that may be excluded from FSI computation.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on the maximum potential identified (FSI 3.00), the following steps are recommended:\n\n1.  **Confirm Zonal FSI:** Immediately procure the full DCPR-2034 document to determine the specific Zonal (Base) FSI applicable to the R-Zone in the Island City with a 21.0 m road width. This will establish the exact amount of Premium FSI or TDR required.\n2.  **Calculate Premium Costs:** Once the Premium FSI area is known, calculate the definitive cost payable to the Planning Authority (at 50% of the ASR rate) for securing the additional FSI entitlement.\n3.  **Optimize FSI Utilization:** Detail the design to maximize FSI exemptions under Regulation 31(1), ensuring that staircases, lifts, and required parking areas (basement/stilt) are designed to meet the criteria for exclusion, thereby increasing the saleable BUA beyond the FSI limit.\n4.  **Verify Height Compliance:** Confirm the specific maximum permissible height for the R-Zone to ensure the proposed 23.0 m height is compliant and obtain necessary Fire and Aviation NOCs if required.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided text excerpts from the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034).
