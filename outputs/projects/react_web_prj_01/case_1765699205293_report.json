        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 14, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 1890 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Zone C (Civil Lines)\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 23.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 15.0\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 1890 sq. m. sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 9.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 1881.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nBased on the provided development regulations, the property falls within the general residential category for plots sized between 500 sq. m. and 2000 sq. m. (Net Plot Area: 1881.0 sq. m.).\n\nThe applicable general development controls permit a maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 120% and a Maximum Ground Coverage (GC) of 60%.\n\n**Zonal Constraint Note:** The context specifically identifies the Civil Lines area as a \"Bungalow Zone\" and notes that such areas are ineligible for certain redevelopment schemes (like godown clusters). While the provided text does not offer specific, unique FAR/GC tables for designated Bungalow Zones, the analysis must proceed using the most relevant general residential table based on plot size. The proposed height of 15.0 m is at the maximum threshold, as the generic rule limits height to \"Below 15m.\"\n\n**Citations:**\n* **Applicable Plot Size Category (500-2000 sq. m.), Ground Coverage (60%), FAR (120), and Height (Below 15m):** Page 90, Table/Excerpt (Above 500 - 2000 sq. m. row).\n* **Parking Requirement (Provision within plot for plots > 300 sq. m.):** Page 90, Note 4.\n* **Civil Lines Designation (Bungalow Zone):** Page 90, Rule 6.4.2.7.\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe calculations are based on the **Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1881.0 sq. m.** and the General Residential Development Controls for the 500 sq. m. to 2000 sq. m. category (FAR 120, GC 60).\n\n| Parameter | Calculation | Result (sq. m.) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Net Plot Area (NPA)** | 1890.0 - 9.0 | 1881.0 sq. m. |\n| **Permissible Ground Coverage (60%)** | 1881.0 * 0.60 | 1128.6 sq. m. |\n| **Base FAR** | 1.20 | 1.20 |\n| **Maximum Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA)** | 1881.0 * 1.20 | **2257.2 sq. m.** |\n| **Premium FSI/TDR Allowed** | (No specific rule found in context) | 0 (Assumed) |\n| **Total Permissible FAR** | Base FAR + Premium FAR | 1.20 |\n| **Permissible Height** | As per general rules for this size | Below 15m |\n\n**Financial Analysis (Premium FSI Cost):**\n\nThe provided context does not establish a mechanism for purchasing Premium FSI or TDR for standard residential plots in this size category. Therefore, the Premium FSI is assumed to be zero.\n\n*   *Calculation:* Cost = 0.5 * ASR * Premium\\_FSI\\_Area\n*   *Cost:* Since Premium\\_FSI\\_Area is 0, the additional cost for enhanced FAR is **\u20b90.0**.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nThe analysis is based on the general residential controls (Page 90). However, critical site-specific information necessary for definitive approval is missing:\n\n1.  **Specific Bungalow Zone/Civil Lines FAR:** While the context identifies Civil Lines as a \"Bungalow Zone\" (Page 90), it fails to provide the dedicated FAR, Ground Coverage, and Height regulations that may supersede the general R-Zone table for this specific, potentially restricted, area.\n2.  **Premium FSI/TDR Matrix:** The document does not contain the standard residential matrix that links road width (23.0 m) to potential purchasable Premium FAR (or TDR), which is typically available in many municipal development codes. This limits the BUA calculation to the Base FAR (120).\n3.  **Height Clearance:** The general rule states the maximum height is \"Below 15m.\" The proposed height is exactly 15.0 m. This small difference requires clarification from the local authority, as the proposed height may technically exceed the specified limit, or it may require specific clearance from bodies like the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and Delhi Fire Service (Page 58).\n4.  **Setback and Basement Rules:** The rules mention that other controls (setbacks, basement, services plans) are detailed in Chapter 17.0 (Development Code), which was not fully provided in the excerpts. Specific setback requirements for a 1881 sq. m. plot are therefore unknown.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Verify Zonal Specifics:** The client must immediately verify the specific Development Control Norms (FAR, GC, Setbacks) applicable to **Residential Bungalow Zones** within Zone C (Civil Lines), as these may be more restrictive than the general R-Zone rules applied here.\n2.  **Confirm Maximum Height:** Clarify with the local planning authority whether a height of exactly 15.0 m is permissible, given the stated limit of \"Below 15m.\"\n3.  **Obtain Premium FAR Schedule:** Request the official schedule detailing the availability and cost of Premium FAR/TDR for residential plots based on plot size and road width (23.0 m) to maximize the BUA potential beyond the 2257.2 sq. m. base entitlement.\n4.  **Review Parking Compliance:** Ensure the design incorporates sufficient on-site parking and loading/unloading facilities, as mandated for plots above 300 sq. m. (Page 90, Note 4).\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based strictly on the provided text excerpts (MPD-2021 modified up to 31/12/2020). It does not constitute final legal or planning approval. All calculations and entitlements must be verified with the relevant local Municipal Corporation or Planning Authority. Specific, detailed regulations for \"Bungalow Zones\" may supersede the general residential rules used in this analysis.",
