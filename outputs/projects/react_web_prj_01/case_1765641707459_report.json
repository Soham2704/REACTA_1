        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 13, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Zone A (Walled City)\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 3.0 (Assuming 3 stories/floors)\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 7.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 1993.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b980.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe subject plot (1993.0 sq. m. Net Area) falls within the size category of 'Above 500 - 2000 sq.m.' for plotted development controls. While the location is specified as Zone A (Walled City), which is identified as an area targeted for redensification and redevelopment, the provided regulations do not contain specific, unique FAR norms for standard R-Zone residential plots within Zone A itself.\n\nTherefore, the analysis proceeds based on the generic development controls applicable to residential plots of this size, which permit a total Floor Area Ratio (FSI/FAR) of 120 and a maximum Ground Coverage of 60%. The maximum permissible physical height is restricted to 15 meters.\n\n**Key Entitlements Identified:**\n\n1.  **Maximum Ground Coverage:** 60% of the Net Plot Area.\n2.  **Maximum FAR:** 120 (Total FSI).\n3.  **Maximum Height:** Below 15m.\n4.  **Parking Requirement:** 3 ECS (Equivalent Car Spaces) per 100 sq.m. of floor area, as the plot size exceeds 300 sq.m., requiring internal provision for parking and loading/unloading.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   Maximum Ground Coverage (60%), FAR (120), and Height (Below 15m) for plots 'Above 500 - 2000 sq.m.': Page 90, Unlabeled Table (Implied Residential Development Controls).\n*   Parking standard (3 ECS / 100 sqm. of floor area): Page 90, Notes 4 and Table.\n*   Zone A identified as part of the existing urban area targeted for redevelopment/modified norms: Page 114, Section 3.1 & Table 3.1.\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe calculations for development potential are based on the **Net Plot Area of 1993.0 sq. m.**\n\n**A. Area Calculations:**\n\n| Parameter | Calculation | Result (sq. m.) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Net Plot Area** | 2000.0 - 7.0 | 1993.0 |\n| **Maximum Ground Coverage (60%)** | 1993.0 * 0.60 | 1195.8 |\n| **Maximum Permissible BUA (120 FAR)** | 1993.0 * (120/100) | 2391.6 |\n\n**B. FSI and Height Entitlements Table:**\n\n| Entitlement Type | Value (as % or Ratio) | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Base FSI (FAR)** | 120 | Total maximum FSI permitted for this plot size category. |\n| **Premium FSI** | 0 (N/A) | No provision for Premium FSI purchase was identified in the cited rules for this specific FAR value. |\n| **TDR Entitlement** | N/A | No Transferable Development Rights (TDR) entitlement was identified in the cited rules. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI (FAR)** | 120 | Maximum FSI based on the current regulations. |\n| **Permissible Height** | Below 15 m | Maximum height restriction. |\n\n**C. Financial Analysis (Premium FSI Charges):**\n\nSince the provided regulations (Page 90) stipulate a total maximum FSI of 120 without differentiating between Base and Premium components, it is assumed that no Premium FSI charges are applicable for achieving the 120 FAR.\n\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b980.0/sq.m.\n*   **Premium FSI Area:** 0 sq. m.\n*   **Calculated Cost:** Cost = 0.5 * ASR * Premium_FSI_Area\n*   **Total Financial Levy (Identified):** \u20b90.00\n    *(Note: This calculation only reflects charges related to Premium FSI, which was not identified. Other statutory levies/charges may apply, as noted in Page 90, Rule 6.4.2.4.)*\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile the analysis provides clear development controls based on plot size, several critical pieces of information are missing or ambiguous, particularly concerning the specific geographical location (Zone A):\n\n1.  **Specific Zone A/Walled City Norms:** Zone A is often designated as a Special Area (Page 114). The provided FSI table (Page 90) appears to be general. Confirmation is needed whether Zone A, R-Zone residential development strictly adheres to the general 120 FAR or if unique, modified development norms (including heritage controls or increased density incentives for redevelopment) supersede this standard.\n2.  **Definition of \"Below 15m\":** While the maximum height is 15m, the exact number of permissible floors (stories) within this height limit, including stilt parking provisions (if required by the 20.0 m road width), is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.\n3.  **Road Width Influence:** In many municipal codes, FSI is enhanced based on abutting road width. No specific provision linking the 20.0 m road width to an FSI increase for a 2000 sq. m. plot was found in the excerpts.\n4.  **Basement Use and Counting:** The rules mention that basement use is governed by MPD-2021 stipulations (Page 90, Note 5). Confirmation is needed on whether the use of the basement for parking/services will be excluded from the 120 FSI calculation, which is standard practice but not explicitly confirmed for this specific residential category in the excerpts.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on the preliminary analysis, the user should take the following steps:\n\n1.  **Confirm Zone A Specifics:** Consult the relevant Zonal Development Plan or the detailed Development Code chapter of MPD-2021 to confirm if the Walled City (Zone A) has overriding or enhanced residential FAR norms compared to the general 120 FSI, especially given its identification as a redevelopment area.\n2.  **Detailed Parking Plan:** Prepare a detailed parking layout showing 3 ECS per 100 sq.m. of the calculated BUA (2391.6 sq. m.). This equates to approximately 72 ECS (2391.6 / 100 * 3). Since the plot is large (1993 sq. m.), this must be accommodated entirely within the plot boundaries (Page 90, Note 4).\n3.  **Structural and Fire Clearance:** Given the plot size and the proposed construction, mandatory conformity to fire safety norms (as per UBBL 2016 and Delhi Fire Services Act) must be ensured early in the design process (Page 90, Note 2).\n4.  **Obtain Revised Building Plan Approval:** The owner must obtain approval of revised building plans from the concerned local body, ensuring compliance with all statutory clearances, including structural safety and fire safety (Page 70, Rule 5.6.6).\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided text excerpts (context). It assumes the cited regulations are current and fully applicable to the specific land use and location parameters. This analysis does not constitute final legal or planning approval. Final development controls must be verified by the relevant municipal authority (ULB/GNCTD).",
