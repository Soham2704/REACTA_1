        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 13, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Island City\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 19.0 m.\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 7.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 1993.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe proposed development falls within the Residential/Commercial zone of the Island City, abutting a 20.0 m wide road. Based on the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR-2034) provisions for this specific road width category (18.00m & above but less than 27m), the plot is eligible for a total permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) of 2.70.\n\nThis total FSI is composed of three components: Basic Zonal FSI, Premium FSI (requiring payment), and Transferable Development Rights (TDR) FSI. The development must utilize the Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1993.0 sq. m. for calculating maximum Built-Up Area (BUA).\n\n**Applicable FSI Breakdown (Road Width 18.00m to 27m):**\n1.  **Zonal (Basic) FSI:** 1.33\n2.  **Additional FSI on Premium:** 0.73\n3.  **Admissible TDR:** 0.64\n4.  **Total Permissible FSI:** 2.70\n\n**Citations:**\n*   FSI Entitlement (Island City, 18m & above but less than 27m Road): Page 83, Table 12, Sr. No. I, Row 4.\n*   Premium Calculation Basis (50% of ASR): Page 177, Regulation (a) (Inferred standard rate, applied to Residential Premium FSI).\n*   FSI Exemptions (Staircases, Parking, Lifts): Page 88, Regulation 31(1).\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe analysis is based on the **Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1993.0 sq. m.**\n\n| FSI Component | FSI Rate | Calculation (NPA * Rate) | Permissible BUA (sq. m.) | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Basic Zonal FSI** | 1.33 | 1993.0 * 1.33 | 2650.69 | Available without premium or TDR |\n| **Premium FSI** | 0.73 | 1993.0 * 0.73 | 1454.89 | Requires payment of premium |\n| **TDR FSI** | 0.64 | 1993.0 * 0.64 | 1275.52 | Requires purchase/utilization of TDR |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.70** | 1993.0 * 2.70 | **5381.10** | Maximum BUA (excluding exempted areas) |\n\n**Financial Calculation: Premium FSI Cost**\n\nThe cost for the Additional FSI (Premium FSI) is calculated based on 50% of the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR) applied to the premium BUA, as per the inferred standard DCPR mechanism derived from the context.\n\n*   **Premium FSI Area:** 1454.89 sq. m.\n*   **ASR Rate (provided):** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n*   **Premium Calculation Formula:** Cost = 0.5 * ASR * Premium FSI Area\n*   **Cost Calculation:** $0.5 \\times \u20b990.0/sq.m. \\times 1454.89 \\text{ sq. m.} = \u20b965,470.05$\n\n**Summary of Entitlements:**\n\n| Metric | Value |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Maximum Permissible FSI** | 2.70 |\n| **Maximum Permissible BUA (FSI)** | 5381.10 sq. m. |\n| **Premium FSI Payable Area** | 1454.89 sq. m. |\n| **Estimated Premium Cost** | \u20b965,470.05 |\n| **Permissible Height** | The proposed height of 19.0 m is likely permissible, but must comply with specific R-Zone height restrictions which are not explicitly defined in the provided context excerpts. |\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile the FSI calculation is robust based on the provided Table 12, the following critical information is missing from the context excerpts, necessitating further inquiry:\n\n1.  **Zonal Height Restrictions:** The maximum permissible building height (in meters or number of floors) for a Residential zone in the Island City with a 20.0 m road width is not provided. The proposed height of 19.0 m must be verified against these specific zonal limits.\n2.  **Mandatory Open Spaces & Setbacks:** The required mandatory marginal open spaces (front, side, rear setbacks) which dictate the final building footprint (ground coverage) are not detailed. These are crucial for determining the feasibility of the proposed development on the 2000 sq. m. plot.\n3.  **Specific Residential Premium Formula:** Although the standard 50% ASR rate was applied (inferred from the IT/ITES section on premium calculation), the exact, definitive formula for calculating premium charges specifically for the Residential/Commercial Additional FSI (Column 5, Table 12) is not explicitly detailed in the excerpts.\n4.  **Parking Requirements:** The required ratio of parking spaces per unit of BUA (e.g., parking per 100 sq. m. of residential area) is not provided. This impacts the design and the calculation of FSI-exempt parking areas (Regulation 31(1) (vi)).\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on the preliminary analysis, the following steps are recommended to confirm the development feasibility:\n\n1.  **Verify Height and Setbacks:** Consult the complete DCPR-2034 document (specifically Regulation 27 and 28, typically) to obtain the mandatory front, side, and rear setback requirements, and the maximum permissible height for the R-Zone in the Island City.\n2.  **Confirm ASR Application:** Due to the extremely low ASR rate provided (\u20b990.0/sq.m.), confirm whether this rate represents the full land rate or a specific index rate component used solely for premium calculation in this jurisdiction.\n3.  **TDR Feasibility Study:** Initiate a market study to determine the availability and current market price of TDR credits required for the 1275.52 sq. m. of TDR BUA, as this component significantly impacts the total project cost and feasibility.\n4.  **Preliminary Building Envelope Study:** Develop a schematic plan incorporating the required setbacks and the 5381.10 sq. m. BUA to ensure the proposed 19.0 m height is sufficient and that the required open spaces are maintained.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided text excerpts from the DCPR-2034 and the specific parameters submitted by the user.
