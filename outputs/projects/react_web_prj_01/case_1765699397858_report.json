        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 14, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 1890 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Gaothan (Assumed Core Area)\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 23.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 15.0 m.\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 1890 sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 9.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 1881.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe plot, being 1890 sq. m. (less than 0.40 Hectares or 4000 sq. m.), is subject to the **Core Area Regulations (15.1)**, assuming the Gaothan location falls within the designated Core Area of the Development Plan. For Residential Buildings in the Core Area, the maximum permissible FSI is 2.20, with an additional 0.30 FSI available upon payment of premium, leading to a total potential FSI of 2.50.\n\nThe proposed height of 15.0 m. is acceptable, as the maximum permissible height based on the 23.0 m. road width (1.5 times the road width) is 34.5 m. The mandatory front setback is 2.00 m. given the road width is 18 m. and above. The required side and rear marginal distances for a plot over 1000 sq. m. are determined by an external regulation (15.6.a), which is not fully detailed in the provided context.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **Applicable Area (Core vs. Non-Core):** Regulation 15.0 (Page 57)\n*   **Base & Premium FSI (Residential Core):** Regulation 15.1.1 (a) (Page 57)\n*   **Front Setback (18m+ street):** Regulation 15.1.1 (b), Sr. No. (v) (Page 57)\n*   **Side & Rear Marginal Distance (>1000 sq. m.):** Regulation 15.1.1 (c) (Page 57)\n*   **Maximum Height Calculation:** Regulation 15.9 (a) (Page 69)\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe calculations for FSI and Built-Up Area (BUA) are based on the Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1881.0 sq. m.\n\n| Entitlement/Metric | FSI Rate | Calculation (1881.0 sq. m. * FSI) | Permissible BUA (sq. m.) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Base Permissible FSI** | 2.20 | $1881.0 \\times 2.20$ | 4138.20 |\n| **Premium FSI (Optional)** | 0.30 | $1881.0 \\times 0.30$ | 564.30 |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | 2.50 | $1881.0 \\times 2.50$ | **4702.50** |\n\n**Setback Requirements:**\n\n*   **Front Setback (23.0 m. Road):** 2.00 m. (Page 57, 15.1.1 (b) (v))\n*   **Side/Rear Marginal Distance (>1000 sq. m.):** As per Regulation 15.6.a (Specific distance not provided in context, required for final plan submission).\n\n**Financial Calculation (Premium FSI):**\n\nThe purchase of the 0.30 Premium FSI requires payment based on the ASR rate. Assuming the standard municipal practice of charging 50% of the ASR rate for the land under the purchased FSI area (the exact percentage for 15.1.1(a) is not specified in the context, but 50% is a common inference for FSI premium):\n\n| Metric | Value | Unit |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Premium FSI Area Purchased | 564.30 | sq. m. |\n| Applicable ASR Rate | 90.00 | \u20b9/sq. m. |\n| Premium Cost Factor (Assumed) | 50% (0.5) | N/A |\n| **Total Premium Cost** | $(0.5 \\times 90.0) \\times 564.30$ | **\u20b9 25,393.50** |\n\n*Note: The calculated cost is based on the extremely low ASR rate of \u20b990.0/sq.m. provided in the input parameters.*\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile a definitive FSI calculation can be made, the following critical regulatory details are missing from the provided context excerpts:\n\n1.  **Specific Marginal Distances for Plots > 1000 sq. m.:** Regulation 15.1.1 (c) directs the requirement for side and rear marginal distances for plots above 1000 sq. m. to **Regulation No. 15.6.a**, which is not included in the context. This is essential for building layout.\n2.  **Explicit Premium Rate for 0.30 FSI:** Regulation 15.1.1(a) permits 0.30 Premium FSI, but the specific percentage of the Annual Statement of Rate (ASR) required for its purchase is not stated. The calculation above uses an inferred rate (50%).\n3.  **Definition of \"Gaothan\":** Although \"Gaothan\" is generally interpreted as a Core Area, the DCPR-2015 definition or map demarcation confirming its inclusion in the \"Core Area\" (as opposed to Non-Core Area) is not available. This confirmation is necessary to finalize the FSI rate of 2.20/2.50.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on the analysis, the user should proceed with the following actionable steps:\n\n1.  **Confirm Marginal Distances:** Immediately consult the full text of **Regulation No. 15.6.a** to determine the precise side and rear marginal distances required for a 1881 sq. m. plot in the Core Area.\n2.  **Verify Premium Rate:** Confirm the exact premium percentage (e.g., 50%, 60%) charged by the Municipal Corporation for the purchase of the 0.30 Premium FSI entitlement under Regulation 15.1.1(a).\n3.  **Finalize Layout Plan:** Prepare architectural plans ensuring:\n    *   Minimum Front Setback of 2.00 m.\n    *   Compliance with the determined side and rear margins (from 15.6.a).\n    *   Maximum Ground Coverage (if applicable, Rule 15.1.1(h) mentions 2/3 of plot area for Core Area, which should be adhered to during design).\n4.  **Parking Provisions:** Review Regulation 20.0 (mentioned in 15.1.1(i)) and the partial requirements listed in the context (Page 72) to ensure adequate parking is provisioned, especially for tenements above 80 sq. m. (1 Car, 2 Scooter/Motorcycle, 2 Cycle spots per unit).\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided textual excerpts from the DCPR-2015 for Nashik Municipal Corporation and the parameters supplied by the user. It does not constitute legal advice or final planning approval. All calculations and interpretations, especially concerning missing regulations (e.g., 15.6.a, Premium rate) and location definitions, must be verified by the relevant Planning Authority before commencing development.",
