        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 13, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Island City\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 15.0\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m. sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 5.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 1995.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe subject property, located in the Island City with an abutting road width of 20.0 m, falls under the specific FSI regulations defined for major arterial roads within the core zone. The road width (20.0 m) places the development potential in the highest category specified in the table before the 27 m threshold.\n\nThe applicable regulations permit a total maximum FSI of 2.70, comprised of Zonal (Basic) FSI, Premium FSI (purchased via premium payment), and Admissible TDR (Transferable Development Rights). The total permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) on the Net Plot Area of 1995.0 sq. m. is 5326.50 sq. m.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **Zoning Entitlements (FSI):** Page 83, Table 12 (Row I, Road width 18.00m & above but less than 27m).\n*   **Premium FSI Calculation Basis (Inferred):** Page 177, Condition (a) (Assuming standard premium FSI follows the principle of 50% of ASR for open develop land, similar to IT/ITES premium calculation).\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe calculations are based on the Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1995.0 sq. m. and the FSI norms derived from DCPR-2034, Table 12 for Island City, Residential Zone, with a road width of 20.0 m.\n\n| Entitlement Component | FSI Coefficient | Calculation (1995.0 sq. m. * FSI) | Built-Up Area (BUA) | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **A. Zonal (Basic) FSI** | 1.33 | 1995.0 * 1.33 | 2653.35 sq. m. | Permissible by right. |\n| **B. Premium FSI** | 0.73 | 1995.0 * 0.73 | 1456.35 sq. m. | Requires payment of premium. |\n| **C. Admissible TDR FSI** | 0.64 | 1995.0 * 0.64 | 1276.80 sq. m. | Requires purchase/utilization of TDR certificate. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI (A+B+C)** | **2.70** | 1995.0 * 2.70 | **5386.50 sq. m.** | Maximum FSI utilization. |\n\n*Note: The calculated total BUA is 5386.50 sq. m. (2653.35 + 1456.35 + 1276.80), which differs slightly from the direct multiplication (1995*2.70 = 5386.50) due to the summation of fractional BUA.*\n\n**Financial Assessment (Premium FSI Cost):**\n\nThe premium payment is required for the utilization of 1456.35 sq. m. of Premium FSI Area.\n\n1.  **Premium Rate Formula (Inferred):** 50% of ASR for the BUA.\n2.  **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n3.  **Premium Rate per sq. m. of BUA:** 0.5 * \u20b990.0/sq.m. = \u20b945.0/sq.m.\n4.  **Total Estimated Premium Cost:**\n    *   1456.35 sq. m. * \u20b945.0/sq.m. = **\u20b965,535.75**\n\n**Permissible Height:**\nThe proposed height of 15.0 m is likely permissible, as the context does not provide specific height restrictions for R-Zone developments based on FSI utilization or road width, other than general limits usually governed by fire safety norms and aviation restrictions (not provided). The context only mentions G+4 limit in relation to Public Parking Lots (PPL) (Page 182, VIII), which is not applicable here.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile a comprehensive FSI entitlement calculation can be performed, the following critical regulatory details are missing from the provided context, necessitating assumptions:\n\n1.  **Exact Premium Calculation Formula for Standard Residential Zone:** The calculation used (50% of ASR) is inferred from the IT/ITES section (Page 177). The specific regulation governing premium calculation for standard Residential Premium FSI (0.73) under Table 12 is required for definitive cost analysis.\n2.  **Fungible/Compensatory Area Entitlement:** The context mentions various areas exempted from FSI or allowed as Fungible Compensatory Area (e.g., staircase, lift wells, parking, Page 88). Without the specific regulation detailing the maximum percentage of Fungible FSI applicable to new residential buildings, the total *saleable* area cannot be accurately maximized.\n3.  **Maximum Permissible Height (H max):** The context lacks the specific height restrictions (e.g., related to fire tender accessibility, plot configuration, or overall DCPR height limits) applicable to a 20.0 m road width in the R-Zone.\n4.  **Open Space and Setback Requirements:** The required front, side, and rear open spaces, which dictate the physical footprint (ground coverage) of the 15.0 m tall structure, are not provided.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on the analysis, the user should proceed with the following actionable steps:\n\n1.  **Confirm Premium Cost:** Immediately verify the specific DCPR regulation governing the calculation of premium for the 0.73 FSI component in the Island City R-Zone to confirm the financial liability, as the current calculation is based on an analogous rule.\n2.  **Secure TDR:** Initiate the process for securing or purchasing TDR certificates equivalent to 1276.80 sq. m. of BUA, as this component is necessary to achieve the maximum permissible FSI of 2.70.\n3.  **Determine Fungible FSI:** Consult the detailed DCPR regulations regarding Regulation 31 (Page 88) to calculate the maximum permissible Fungible Compensatory Area that can be utilized, which will significantly increase the total constructed area beyond the FSI limit.\n4.  **Review Building Envelope:** Obtain specific setback, open space, and ground coverage regulations to design the building footprint, ensuring the proposed 15.0 m height complies with fire safety and development control rules for the 20.0 m road width.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided textual excerpts from the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR-2034). It does not account for site-specific conditions, heritage restrictions, reservation overlaps, or subsequent amendments to the regulations. Final development potential must be confirmed by the relevant Municipal Corporation planning authority.",
