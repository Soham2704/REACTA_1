        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 13, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n*   **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n*   **Location Type:** Island City\n*   **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n*   **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n*   **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n*   **Proposed Height:** 15.0 m.\n*   **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m. sq. m.\n*   **Deductions:** 10.0 sq. m.\n*   **Net Plot Area:** 1990.0 sq. m.\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe subject property is located in the Island City, zoned Residential, and abuts a 20.0 m wide road. Based on the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034), this configuration allows for a combined Floor Space Index (FSI) derived from Zonal (Basic) FSI, Premium FSI (on payment), and Admissible Transferable Development Rights (TDR).\n\nThe 20.0 m road width falls within the 18.00m & above but less than 27m category defined in the FSI table for the Island City Residential zone. This combination yields a maximum permissible FSI of 2.7. Furthermore, the total FSI (2.7) is below the overall maximum cap of 3.00 specified for plots up to 2000 sq. m., ensuring the calculated FSI is fully permissible. The total maximum Built-Up Area (BUA) entitlement is calculated on the Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1990.0 sq. m.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   FSI Components for Island City (18.00m to 27m Road): Page 83, Table 12\n*   Overall Maximum Permissible FSI Cap (Up to 2000 sq. m.): Page 182, Section VII\n*   Premium FSI Cost Calculation Basis (Inferred Standard Rate): Page 177, Condition (a)\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe analysis is based on a **Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1990.0 sq. m.**\n\n| FSI Component | FSI Value | Calculation (1990.0 sq. m. * FSI) | Permissible BUA (sq. m.) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Zonal (Basic) FSI** | 1.33 | 1990.0 * 1.33 | 2646.70 |\n| **Premium FSI** | 0.73 | 1990.0 * 0.73 | 1452.70 |\n| **Admissible TDR FSI** | 0.64 | 1990.0 * 0.64 | 1273.60 |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.70** | N/A | **5373.00** |\n| **Permissible Height** | N/A | *Not specified in context; proposed 15.0 m.* | N/A |\n\n**Financial Analysis (Premium FSI)**\n\nThe Premium FSI component (0.73) requires payment. Based on the standard practice outlined in the context for additional FSI, the premium is calculated at 50% of the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR).\n\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0 / sq. m.\n*   **Premium Rate:** 0.5 * ASR = 0.5 * \u20b990.0 = \u20b945.0 per sq. m. of Premium BUA.\n*   **Premium BUA Area:** 1452.70 sq. m.\n\n| Financial Item | Calculation | Estimated Cost (\u20b9) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Premium FSI Cost** | 1452.70 sq. m. * \u20b945.0/sq.m. | **65,371.50** |\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile the FSI calculation is definitive based on the provided table, several critical planning elements necessary for final approval are missing from the context:\n\n1.  **Maximum Permissible Height:** The context does not provide the specific height restriction (in meters) for an R-Zone development in the Island City. The proposed height (15.0 m) must be verified against this limit and fire safety regulations.\n2.  **Mandatory Setbacks and Open Spaces:** Specific requirements for front, side, and rear setbacks, and mandatory open spaces (LOS) are crucial for determining the actual building footprint (Ground Coverage). The available excerpts only mention areas exempted from FSI calculation but not the minimum dimensional requirements for setbacks.\n3.  **TDR Acquisition and Utilization Rules:** The report assumes the full TDR potential (0.64 FSI) can be utilized, but the context does not detail the process, documentation (TDR certificates), or specific geographical restrictions for TDR utilization.\n4.  **Parking Requirements:** The mandatory number of parking spaces required for the proposed residential BUA (5373.0 sq. m.) is not provided, which directly impacts the design of basements and stilt floors.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on this preliminary analysis, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1.  **Confirm Height and Setbacks:** Obtain the specific DCPR-2034 regulations regarding maximum permissible building height and mandatory open space requirements (setbacks) for R-Zone in the Island City to finalize the building envelope and ensure the proposed 15.0 m height is compliant.\n2.  **Verify Premium Calculation:** Confirm the exact formula (ASR percentage) applicable to the general Premium FSI component listed in Table 12, Column 5, as the current calculation is based on the inferred rate from the IT/ITES section (50% ASR).\n3.  **TDR Strategy:** Initiate the process for acquiring the necessary TDR certificates corresponding to 1273.60 sq. m. of BUA and confirm their eligibility for use on the subject plot.\n4.  **Preliminary Design & Parking Study:** Commence a preliminary architectural design study incorporating the calculated BUA (5373.0 sq. m.) and incorporating required parking levels (basement/stilt), ensuring compliance with FSI exemptions for parking areas (Regulation 31(1) (v) and (vi)).\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided textual excerpts of the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034.
