        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 13, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Zone A (Walled City)\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 25.0 m.\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m. sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 9.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 1991.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe analysis of the 2000 sq. m. residential plot is constrained by the limited context provided, particularly the lack of a definitive, specific table for standard Residential (R-Zone) development controls linked to road width (20.0 m) or the specific Zone A (Walled City) classification.\n\nBased on the available excerpts, the most likely applicable general development controls for a plot of this size (Above 500 - 2000 sq. m.) are inferred from an incomplete table snippet that appears to govern plot size categories:\n\n1.  **Floor Area Ratio (FAR):** The permissible Base FAR is inferred to be 120.\n2.  **Ground Coverage (GC):** The maximum permissible Ground Coverage is 60%.\n3.  **Height Restriction:** The maximum permissible height for this category is restricted to \"Below 15m.\" The proposed height of 25.0 m significantly exceeds this restriction and would likely require special clearances or be non-permissible under these assumed rules.\n4.  **Premium FSI/TDR:** No specific regulations or mechanisms for utilizing Premium FSI or TDR (which often relies on road width) are detailed in the provided context for standard residential plots. Therefore, the analysis assumes Base FSI only.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **Maximum Ground Coverage (60%) & Base FAR (120):** Page 90, Row for \"Above 500 - 2000 sq.m.\" (Inferred from column structure).\n*   **Maximum Height (Below 15m):** Page 90, Row for \"Above 500 - 2000 sq.m.\"\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nCalculations are based on the **Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1991.0 sq. m.** and the inferred Base FSI of 120.\n\n| Development Control | Permissible Value | Calculation (Based on NPA 1991.0 sq. m.) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Base FSI** | 120 | 1991.0 sq. m. * 1.20 |\n| **Premium FSI** | N/A (0) | No rules found in context |\n| **TDR Utilization** | N/A (0) | No rules found in context |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | 120 | 120 + 0 + 0 |\n| **Maximum Built-Up Area (BUA)** | 2389.2 sq. m. | 1991.0 sq. m. * 1.20 |\n| **Maximum Ground Coverage (GC)** | 60% | 1991.0 sq. m. * 0.60 = 1194.6 sq. m. |\n| **Permissible Height** | Below 15.0 m. | Restriction cited on Page 90 |\n\n**Financial Analysis (Premium FSI Charges):**\n\nSince no Premium FSI was calculated or allowed based on the available text, the financial charge for enhanced FAR is **\u20b90.0**.\n\n*   *Note:* If a Premium FSI mechanism were available, the cost calculation would be: Cost = 0.5 * ASR * Premium_FSI_Area.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nThe provided context is highly specific and lacks the core regulatory tables typically required for a definitive residential plot analysis, leading to critical unknowns:\n\n1.  **Specific R-Zone Development Controls:** The primary table linking FSI, Ground Coverage, and Height to plot size (Page 90) appears incomplete and may be contextualized within the surrounding text (related to godown/commercial activities). The standard residential plotted development controls (Para 4.4.3, referenced on Page 69) are not provided.\n2.  **Zone A (Walled City) Specific Regulations:** Zone A is a sensitive area (Walled City). The context does not provide specific heritage or conservation-related development controls which often supersede general zoning rules, especially regarding height and setbacks.\n3.  **FSI Enhancement Mechanism:** There are no rules detailing how the 20.0 m road width might entitle the plot owner to purchase Premium FSI or utilize TDR to exceed the Base FAR of 120.\n4.  **Height Relaxation:** There is no provision found to justify the proposed 25.0 m height, which is restricted to below 15.0 m under the inferred rules.\n5.  **Parking Standards for R-Zone:** While parking standards are mentioned (e.g., 3 ECS / 100 sqm on Page 90), the specific applicable standard for a standard residential building of this size in Zone A must be confirmed, as the provided rules are often linked to commercial or specific institutional uses.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Verify Zoning Table:** Immediately obtain the definitive development control table for Residential (R-Zone) plots specifically applicable to Zone A (Walled City) or the relevant section of MPD-2021 (likely Para 4.4.3 or equivalent) to confirm the Base FSI, Ground Coverage, and Maximum Height.\n2.  **Review Height Compliance:** The proposed height of 25.0 m is likely non-compliant with the inferred 15.0 m limit. The client must either reduce the proposed height or investigate specific provisions for height relaxation in Zone A, subject to clearance from AAI and Delhi Fire Service.\n3.  **Determine Premium FSI Eligibility:** Research the specific regulations governing the purchase of Premium FSI or utilization of TDR based on the 20.0 m abutting road width to maximize the achievable BUA beyond the Base FSI of 120.\n4.  **Calculate Parking Requirements:** Once the final BUA is determined, calculate the mandatory ECS (Equivalent Car Space) requirement and ensure the design incorporates sufficient on-site parking provision as mandated for plots above 300 sq. m. (Page 90, Note 4).\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided text excerpts from the MPD-2021 document. It is not a substitute for official consultation with the local municipal authority (ULB) or a licensed architect/planner who can access the full and current version of the regulations applicable to Zone A (Walled City). The inferred rules must be verified.",
