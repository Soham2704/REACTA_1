Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe proposed residential development falls within the Island City zone, abutting a 20.0 m road. Based on the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR-2034) Table 12, a road width between 18.00m and 27m permits a maximum combined FSI of 2.7 for Residential/Commercial zones. This maximum FSI is achieved through a combination of Zonal (Basic) FSI, Additional FSI upon premium payment, and Admissible Transferable Development Rights (TDR).\n\nThe development potential is calculated on the Net Plot Area (1997.0 sq. m.). The premium for the Additional FSI component is calculated at 50% of the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR) for the corresponding Built-up Area (BUA).\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **FSI Entitlements (Island City, 18m to <27m Road):** Page 83, Table 12 (Sr No I, Row 4)\n*   **Zonal (Basic) FSI:** 1.33 (Page 83, Table 12)\n*   **Additional FSI (Premium):** 0.73 (Page 83, Table 12)\n*   **TDR Admissibility:** 0.64 (Page 83, Table 12)\n*   **Premium Calculation Rate:** 50% of ASR (Page 177, condition 'a')\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe development potential is calculated based on the Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1997.0 sq. m.\n\n| FSI Component | FSI Rate (Multiplier) | Calculation (1997.0 sq. m. * FSI) | Built-up Area (BUA) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Zonal (Basic) FSI** | 1.33 | 1997.0 * 1.33 | 2,656.01 sq. m. |\n| **Additional (Premium) FSI** | 0.73 | 1997.0 * 0.73 | 1,457.81 sq. m. |\n| **Admissible TDR FSI** | 0.64 | 1997.0 * 0.64 | 1,278.08 sq. m. |\n| **TOTAL PERMISSIBLE FSI** | **2.70** | | **5,391.90 sq. m.** |\n\n**Financial Calculation (Premium FSI Cost):**\n\nThe premium is mandatory for utilizing the Additional FSI (0.73) component.\n\n1.  **Applicable Premium BUA:** 1,457.81 sq. m.\n2.  **ASR Rate (Provided):** \u20b980.0/sq.m.\n3.  **Premium Rate (50% of ASR):** 0.5 * \u20b980.0/sq.m. = \u20b940.0/sq.m.\n4.  **Total Premium Cost:** BUA * Premium Rate\n    $1,457.81 \\text{ sq. m.} \\times \u20b940.0/\\text{sq.m.} = \u20b958,312.40$\n\n**Financial Summary:**\n| Item | Cost/Area | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Premium Cost (for 0.73 FSI)** | **\u20b958,312.40** | Payable to the Planning Authority. |\n| **TDR Area Required** | 1,278.08 sq. m. | Must be procured separately (cost not calculable). |\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile a comprehensive FSI calculation can be performed, several critical items required for final project approval are missing from the provided regulations:\n\n1.  **Specific Setback and Open Space Requirements:** The context includes regulations on FSI exemptions for structures in open spaces (Regulation 31(1)(i) and (ii)), but the actual minimum front, side, and rear setbacks required for an R-Zone development on a 20.0m road are absent.\n2.  **Maximum Permissible Height:** The proposed height is 15.0 m. Compliance with maximum permissible height, which is typically tied to road width and fire safety regulations, cannot be verified.\n3.  **Parking Requirements:** Mandatory parking ratios (e.g., spaces per 100 sq. m. of BUA) are missing. While Regulation 31(1)(iii) and (vi) discuss FSI exemptions for parking, the quantity of required parking is unknown.\n4.  **TDR Cost:** The cost of purchasing the admissible TDR (1,278.08 sq. m. BUA) is not provided, making the total acquisition cost of the development potential incomplete.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on the confirmed FSI potential, the following actionable steps are recommended for the developer:\n\n1.  **Confirm Road Line and Net Plot Area:** Verify the official road line demarcation (RL) to ensure the 20.0 m road width and the calculated Net Plot Area (1997.0 sq. m.) are accurate, as these are foundational to all FSI calculations.\n2.  **Procure TDR Certificates:** Initiate the process to acquire TDR certificates equivalent to 1,278.08 sq. m. of BUA, which is mandatory to achieve the maximum permissible FSI of 2.7.\n3.  **Obtain Detailed Zonal Regulations:** Secure the full DCPR-2034 document to confirm the minimum mandatory setbacks, maximum building height limits, and parking space requirements specific to the R-Zone in the Island City area.\n4.  **Prepare Financial Plan:** Budget for the mandatory premium payment of \u20b958,312.40 for the Additional FSI, and separately estimate the market cost for the required TDR.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided text excerpts from the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR-2034).
