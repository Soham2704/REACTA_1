Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe analysis is based on the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034) for the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, specifically focusing on the Island City Residential Zone.\n\nGiven the abutting road width of 20.0 m., the plot falls into the category allowing for substantial Floor Space Index (FSI) utilization through a combination of Zonal (Basic) FSI, Premium FSI, and Transferable Development Rights (TDR). The 20.0 m. road width is categorized as \"18.00m & above but less than 27m\" for FSI calculation purposes in the Island City.\n\nThe maximum permissible FSI for the proposed residential use is 2.70, which includes a component of 0.73 FSI available upon payment of a premium calculated at 50% of the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR) for the corresponding built-up area.\n\n**Citations:**\n* **FSI Entitlements (Basic, Premium, TDR):** Page 83, Table 12, Row I (18.00m & above but less than 27m).\n* **Premium Calculation Rate:** Page 177, condition (a) (stating premium shall be recovered for the BUA at the rate of 50% of ASR).\n* **FSI Exemptions (Staircase, Parking, etc.):** Page 88, Regulation 31(1).\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe calculations for the permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) are based on the **Net Plot Area (NPA)** of 1998.0 sq. m.\n\n| Entitlement Type | FSI Rate | Calculation (NPA * FSI) | Permissible BUA (sq. m.) | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Zonal (Basic) FSI** | 1.33 | 1998.0 * 1.33 | 2657.34 | Basic entitlement, no charge. |\n| **Premium FSI** | 0.73 | 1998.0 * 0.73 | 1458.54 | Requires premium payment. |\n| **Admissible TDR FSI** | 0.64 | 1998.0 * 0.64 | 1278.72 | Requires TDR purchase/utilization. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.70** | 1998.0 * 2.70 | **5394.60** | Maximum allowable FSI BUA. |\n\n**Financial Calculation (Premium FSI Cost):**\nThe premium is calculated for the area derived from the Premium FSI (0.73) at 50% of the ASR rate.\n\n1.  **Premium BUA:** 1458.54 sq. m.\n2.  **ASR Rate:** \u20b988.0/sq.m.\n3.  **Premium Rate:** 0.5 * ASR = 0.5 * \u20b988.0/sq.m. = \u20b944.0/sq.m.\n\n*   **Total Premium Cost = Premium BUA * Premium Rate**\n*   Total Premium Cost = 1458.54 sq. m. * \u20b944.0/sq.m.\n*   **Total Premium Cost Payable:** **\u20b964,175.76**\n\n**Permissible Height:**\nThe proposed height of 41.0 m. must comply with specific fire safety and road width regulations which are not detailed in the provided context excerpts. Generally, taller buildings require greater road width and enhanced fire infrastructure.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile the FSI entitlement is clearly defined, several critical details necessary for final building approval are missing from the provided context:\n\n1.  **Maximum Permissible Height:** The specific maximum height (in meters) allowed for a residential building on a 20.0 m. road in the Island City R-Zone is not provided. The proposed 41.0 m. height needs specific verification against fire and aviation rules.\n2.  **Required Setbacks and Open Spaces:** The specific front, side, and rear setback requirements necessary to calculate the actual building footprint (ground coverage) are not available.\n3.  **Fungible Compensatory Area (FCA) Entitlement:** Regulation 31 mentions Fungible Compensatory Area, but the specific percentage of additional BUA granted as FCA (usually 35% of the permissible FSI BUA for residential) is not explicitly detailed in these excerpts. This area would significantly increase the total constructed area beyond the FSI BUA of 5394.60 sq. m.\n4.  **Parking Requirements:** Regulation 44 is cited (Page 88), but the specific parking norms (spaces per 100 sq. m. of BUA) for the Residential Zone are missing, which affects the planning of basement and stilt areas.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on this analysis, the user should proceed with the following actionable steps:\n\n1.  **Verify Height Compliance:** Immediately verify the maximum permissible height for a 20.0 m. road in the Island City R-Zone to ensure the proposed 41.0 m. height is compliant with the relevant DCPR sections (likely Regulation 19 or 27) and fire safety norms.\n2.  **Calculate Fungible FSI:** Obtain the exact percentage entitlement for Fungible Compensatory Area (FCA) to determine the final maximum saleable area, as this area is typically granted free of FSI computation upon payment of premium.\n3.  **Determine Setbacks:** Consult the specific regulations governing mandatory open spaces and setbacks for the Residential Zone based on the plot size and road width to finalize the architectural design and ground coverage.\n4.  **Budget TDR Acquisition:** Initiate the budgeting and procurement process for 1278.72 sq. m. of TDR (Transferable Development Rights) required to achieve the full 2.70 FSI potential.\n5.  **Prepare for Premium Payment:** Prepare to pay the calculated \u20b964,175.76 premium for the 0.73 Premium FSI, following the payment schedule (usually linked to IOD/CC stages).\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided text excerpts from the DCPR-2034 and the user-defined parameters. It does not constitute final planning approval or legal advice. The user must consult the full, current version of the DCPR-2034 and secure necessary approvals from the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) before undertaking any development. The ASR rate provided (\u20b988.0/sq.m.) is exceptionally low and should be verified against the official Annual Statement of Rates for the specific plot location and year of sanction.",
