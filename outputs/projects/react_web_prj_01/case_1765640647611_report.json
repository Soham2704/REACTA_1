        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 13, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n*   **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n*   **Location Type:** Island City\n*   **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n*   **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n*   **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n*   **Proposed Height:** 25.0 m.\n*   **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m.\n*   **Deductions:** 6.0 sq. m.\n*   **Net Plot Area:** 1994.0 sq. m.\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe analysis is based on the development control norms found in the provided excerpts, which correspond to the Master Plan for Delhi (MPD-2021). **Crucially, the specific zoning regulations for \"Island City\" are not available, and therefore, the analysis proceeds under the assumption that the provided MPD-2021 Residential (R-Zone) norms govern the development potential for a standard plotted residential property.**\n\nFor a plot of 2000 sq. m. in the Residential category, the applicable controls fall within the range of \"Above 500 - 2000 sq. m.\" plot size.\n\n**Key Applicable Controls:**\n\n1.  **Floor Area Ratio (FAR):** The maximum permissible FAR is 120.\n2.  **Ground Coverage (GC):** The maximum permissible Ground Coverage is 60%.\n3.  **Height Restriction:** The maximum permissible height is restricted to **Below 15m**. The proposed height of 25.0 m is a significant deviation and is non-compliant with the standard residential norms identified.\n4.  **Parking:** Provision for parking and loading/unloading must be made within the plot, as the plot size (1994.0 sq. m.) is above 300 sq. m. Parking standards are likely 3 ECS / 100 sqm. of floor area, based on related notes.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   Maximum Ground Coverage (60%) and FAR (120) for 500 - 2000 sq. m. plots: Page 90, Development Control Table (Row 2).\n*   Maximum Height (Below 15m) for this category: Page 90, Development Control Table.\n*   On-plot parking requirement for plots above 300 sq. m.: Page 90, Note 4.\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe calculations are performed based on the **Net Plot Area of 1994.0 sq. m.** and the derived maximum FAR of 120.\n\n| Metric | Regulation / Calculation | Result |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Net Plot Area** | $2000.0 \\text{ sq. m.} - 6.0 \\text{ sq. m.}$ | **1994.0 sq. m.** |\n| **Max Ground Coverage** | $60\\%$ | **1196.4 sq. m.** |\n| **Base FSI (FAR)** | 120 | **120** |\n| **Premium FSI** | Not explicitly provided or allowed in context | **0** |\n| **TDR/Transferable FAR** | Not mentioned or applicable in context | **0** |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | Base FSI + Premium FSI + TDR | **120** |\n| **Maximum Built-Up Area (BUA)** | $1994.0 \\text{ sq. m.} \\times 1.20$ | **2392.8 sq. m.** |\n| **Permissible Height** | As per R-Zone table (Below 15m) | **< 15.0 m.** |\n\n**Financial Analysis (Premium FSI Cost):**\n\nThe provided rules do not grant or specify Premium FSI for this category (500 - 2000 sq.m.) linked to road width or payment, resulting in a total FSI of 120.\n\n*   **Premium FSI Area:** 0 sq. m.\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b990.0 / sq. m.\n*   **Cost of Premium FSI:** $0.5 \\times \\text{ASR Rate} \\times \\text{Premium FSI Area}$\n*   **Calculated Cost:** $0.5 \\times \u20b990.0 \\times 0$ = **\u20b90.0**\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nThe comprehensive analysis is limited by the following missing or conflicting regulatory details:\n\n1.  **Jurisdictional Specificity:** The user specified \"Island City,\" but the provided regulations are explicitly titled \"MPD-2021,\" which governs Delhi. The actual development controls for the specified jurisdiction may differ significantly, especially regarding FSI, height, and premium charges.\n2.  **Premium FSI/TDR Mechanisms:** The provided table (Page 90) only establishes the Base FSI (120). There is no explicit rule within the context that allows for the purchase of Premium FSI or utilization of TDR based on the 20.0 m road width for this specific Residential plot size, which would typically be required to exceed the Base FSI.\n3.  **Detailed Setback and Building Envelope Rules:** While Ground Coverage (60%) is specified, the exact mandatory setback requirements (front, rear, side) necessary to define the building envelope are not detailed for the 2000 sq. m. category in the excerpts.\n4.  **Height Relaxation Criteria:** The proposed height (25.0 m) is non-compliant with the standard 15m limit. Criteria for height relaxation, often tied to road width or specialized fire safety clearances, are not provided for standard residential plots.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nBased on the preliminary analysis, the user should take the following actionable steps:\n\n1.  **Verify Governing Regulations:** Immediately confirm the current and applicable Zoning Regulations and Development Control norms specific to the \"Island City\" jurisdiction, as the current analysis relies on Delhi (MPD-2021) standards, which may be irrelevant.\n2.  **Review Height Compliance:** The proposed building height of 25.0 m is non-compliant with the 15.0 m limit derived from the MPD-2021 norms. The user must either redesign the building to comply with the <15m limit or seek specific statutory clearance/relaxation that permits the enhanced height, subject to clearances from the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and the Delhi Fire Service (DFS) (as inferred from other height-related rules in the context, e.g., Page 118).\n3.  **Parking Plan Development:** Prepare a detailed plan for integrated, on-site parking and loading/unloading facilities, ensuring the provision meets the required standard (likely 3 ECS per 100 sq. m. of floor area, equating to 72 ECS for the permissible BUA of 2392.8 sq. m.).\n4.  **Confirm Premium FSI Eligibility:** If the goal is to maximize the FSI beyond 120, the user must consult the local code to determine if Premium FSI or TDR is purchasable or applicable for R-Zone plots abutting a 20.0 m road, and calculate the associated levies/charges.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based solely on the provided context excerpts (MPD-2021) and specific user parameters. It is not a substitute for official legal or municipal planning advice. All entitlements, calculations, and financial estimates must be verified against the most current and locally adopted zoning code of the specified jurisdiction (\"Island City\") prior to any development application or financial commitment.",
