        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 13, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Town Planning Scheme\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Residential Building\n* **Proposed Height:** 23.0\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m. sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 7.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 1993.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b980.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe development proposal involves a large residential plot (1993.0 sq. m. Net Plot Area) abutting a significant road (20.0 m width) with a proposed building height of 23.0 m.\n\nSince the specific FSI table for development in a Town Planning Scheme (TPS) or the detailed regulations for \"Outside Core Area\" (Table 7) are missing from the provided context, this analysis proceeds based on the explicit regulations available for **Core Area Residential Buildings** (Rule 15.1.1), as these provide the only defined FSI limits.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n1.  **FSI Entitlement:** Assuming the Core Area FSI limits apply, the project is entitled to a maximum FSI of 2.50 (2.20 Basic + 0.30 Premium).\n2.  **Height Compliance:** The proposed height of 23.0 m is generally permissible, as the maximum height based on the 20.0 m road width is 30.0 m (1.5 times the road width).\n3.  **Setback Requirement Change:** Due to the proposed height exceeding 15.0 m (23.0 m proposed), the marginal distance requirements shift from the Core Area low-rise rules to the **Outside Core Area regulations (Table 7)**, which are currently unavailable.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **Basic & Premium FSI:** Rule 15.1.1(a), Page 57.\n*   **Front Setback (Low-Rise Core):** Rule 15.1.1(b)(v) (2.00 m for 18 m+ road), Page 57.\n*   **Side/Rear Setback (High Plot Area Core):** Rule 15.1.1(c) (Reference to Reg. 15.6.a for plots > 1000 sq. m.), Page 57.\n*   **Height Limitation:** Rule 15.9(a) (1.5 times the width of road), Page 69.\n*   **Height Trigger for Non-Core Setbacks:** Rule 15.1.2(c) (Marginal distances for buildings > 15 m), Page 58.\n*   **TPS Road Widening Exclusion:** Rule 23.2, Proviso (a) (Exemption from road widening FSI concession in TPS), Page 103.\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe calculations below are based on the **Net Plot Area (NPA) of 1993.0 sq. m.** and the FSI regulations for Core Area Residential Buildings (Rule 15.1.1(a)).\n\n| Entitlement Category | FSI Rate (Assumed) | Calculation (sq. m.) | Permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Net Plot Area (NPA)** | N/A | 1993.0 sq. m. | N/A |\n| **1. Base FSI** | 2.20 | 1993.0 * 2.20 | 4384.6 sq. m. |\n| **2. Premium FSI** | 0.30 | 1993.0 * 0.30 | 597.9 sq. m. |\n| **3. TDR FSI** | 0.00 | N/A | 0.00 sq. m. |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.50** | N/A | **4982.5 sq. m.** |\n| **Permissible Height** | N/A | 1.5 * 20.0 m road width | 30.0 m |\n\n---\n**Financial Analysis (Premium FSI Cost)**\n\nPremium FSI is required for the additional 0.30 FSI utilized.\n\n*   **Premium FSI Area:** 597.9 sq. m.\n*   **ASR Rate (Provided):** \u20b980.0/sq.m.\n*   **Premium Cost Formula (Standard Industry Proxy):** 0.5 * ASR Rate * Premium FSI Area\n\n$Premium\\ Cost = 0.5 \\times \u20b980.0/sq.m. \\times 597.9\\ sq.m.$\n$Premium\\ Cost = \u20b940.0 \\times 597.9$\n$Premium\\ Cost = \u20b923,916.00$\n\n*(Note: The provided ASR rate of \u20b980.0/sq.m. appears to be a nominal value used for calculation purposes, resulting in a low premium cost.)*\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile the analysis provides a likely FSI entitlement, several critical regulatory details required for final building plan submission are absent in the provided context:\n\n1.  **Specific FSI for Town Planning Schemes (TPS):** The context does not provide a separate FSI table specifically for R-Zones within Town Planning Schemes. It is assumed the Core Area (2.50 FSI) rules apply, but this must be confirmed.\n2.  **Outside Core Area Regulations (Table 7):** Rule 15.2.1 states that regulations for outside core areas are found in Table 7. Since the proposed height (23.0 m) exceeds 15.0 m, the mandatory marginal distances are governed by the Outside Core Area rules (Rule 15.1.2(c)). **Table 7 is essential for determining the required front, side, and rear setbacks.**\n3.  **Detailed Marginal Distance Rule 15.6.a:** For a plot exceeding 1000 sq. m., the side and rear margins are referred to Rule 15.6.a (Rule 15.1.1(c)). This specific rule text is missing and is necessary to confirm minimum clear distances for the 1993.0 sq. m. plot.\n4.  **Premium FSI Charging Rate:** The exact formula or percentage for calculating the premium cost for the 0.30 FSI is not explicitly stated in the context (only the formula for double-height terraces is mentioned in 15.8.3(d)). The calculation above uses a standard industry proxy (50% of ASR).\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Obtain Table 7 and Rule 15.6.a:** Immediately request the full text of **Table 7** and **Regulation 15.6.a** from the Nashik Municipal Corporation DCPR-2015 to accurately calculate the required side and rear marginal distances for a 23.0 m high building.\n2.  **Confirm Core/Non-Core Status:** Verify the plot's location status (Core Area, Non-Core Area, or specific TPS Zone) on the Development Plan map to confirm the applicability of the 2.50 Total FSI used in this report.\n3.  **Verify ASR and Premium Calculation:** Confirm the official rate and method used by the Planning Authority to calculate the premium for the 0.30 FSI component, especially given the low ASR rate provided (\u20b980.0/sq.m.).\n4.  **Review Parking Requirements:** Refer to Regulation 20.0 (as cited in Rule 15.1.2(i) and 8.0) to ensure adequate parking is planned for the 4982.5 sq. m. BUA, noting that parking area is excluded from FSI consumption (Rule 15.8.2(b)).\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided textual excerpts of the Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR-2015) for Nashik Municipal Corporation. The analysis relies on assumptions where specific rules or tables (e.g., Table 7, Rule 15.6.a) relevant to the building height and location were missing. This report should not be used as a substitute for official approval or consultation with the relevant Planning Authority.",
