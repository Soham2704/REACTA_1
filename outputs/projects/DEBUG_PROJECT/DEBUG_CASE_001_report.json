        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** December 07, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n* **Plot Size:** 2000 sq. m.\n* **Location Type:** Island City\n* **Abutting Road Width:** 20.0 m.\n* **Zoning:** Residential (R-Zone)\n* **Proposed Use:** Not Specified\n* **Proposed Height:** 15.0\n* **Gross Plot Area:** 2000 sq. m. sq. m.\n* **Deductions:** 0.0 sq. m.\n* **Net Plot Area:** 2000.0 sq. m.\n* **ASR Rate:** \u20b90.0/sq.m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nThe analysis is based on the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034) for the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). Since the plot is located in the Island City, is zoned Residential (R-Zone), and abuts a 20.0 m road, the maximum permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) is governed by the combined FSI table for Residential/Commercial zones.\n\nThe 20.0 m road width falls into the category of \"18.00m & above but less than 27m.\" This category permits a total FSI of 2.7, which is composed of Basic Zonal FSI, Premium FSI, and Admissible Transferable Development Rights (TDR).\n\n**Key Rules Identified:**\n\n1.  **Maximum Permissible FSI:** For an Island City Residential plot abutting a road between 18.00 m and 27 m, the total FSI is capped at 2.7.\n2.  **FSI Components:** This FSI is achieved through a combination of Zonal FSI (1.33), Premium FSI (0.73), and TDR (0.64).\n3.  **Exempted Areas:** Areas related to parking (in stilt/basement), covered parking spaces (up to 50% additional), staircase rooms, and lift wells may be excluded from FSI calculation, often subject to premium payment.\n\n**Citations:**\n*   **Maximum Permissible FSI (2.7):** Page 83, TABLE 12 (Sr No. I, Road width 18.00m & above but less than 27m).\n*   **FSI Component Breakdown (1.33, 0.73, 0.64):** Page 83, TABLE 12.\n*   **Exemption for Parking/Ancillary Uses:** Page 88, Regulation 31(1) (iii), (v), (vi).\n*   **Premium for Staircases/Lifts:** Page 88, Regulation 31(1) (iv).\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nBased on the Net Plot Area (NPA) of 2000.0 sq. m. and the applicable FSI of 2.7, the maximum total Built-Up Area (BUA) is calculated below.\n\n| Entitlement Component | FSI Rate | Calculation (2000.0 sq. m. * FSI) | Built-Up Area (BUA) | Requirement |\n| :-------------------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------ | :---------- |\n| **1. Zonal (Basic) FSI** | 1.33 | 2000.0 * 1.33 | 2660.0 sq. m. | Standard Entitlement |\n| **2. Premium FSI** | 0.73 | 2000.0 * 0.73 | 1460.0 sq. m. | Requires Premium Payment |\n| **3. Admissible TDR FSI** | 0.64 | 2000.0 * 0.64 | 1280.0 sq. m. | Requires TDR Certificate |\n| **Total Permissible FSI** | **2.70** | **2000.0 * 2.70** | **5400.0 sq. m.** | **Maximum BUA** |\n\n**Financial Calculation (Premium FSI)**\n\nThe Premium FSI component (0.73 FSI) results in a Premium BUA of 1460.0 sq. m. This area requires payment of a premium, typically calculated based on the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR).\n\n*   **Premium Area:** 1460.0 sq. m.\n*   **ASR Rate:** \u20b90.0/sq.m. (as provided in parameters)\n*   **Premium Cost (Inferred Standard Rate):** 0.5 * ASR Rate * Premium Area\n*   **Total Premium Cost:** 0.5 * \u20b90.0/sq.m. * 1460.0 sq. m. = **\u20b90.0**\n\n*Note: Since the provided ASR rate is zero (\u20b90.0/sq.m.), the calculated financial cost for the premium FSI component is zero. In a real-world scenario, this premium amount would be substantial.*\n\n**Exempted Area Potential:**\n\nIn addition to the 5400.0 sq. m. BUA, areas related to parking, stilt, basement, and possibly staircases/lifts (subject to specific premium payment under Reg. 31(1)(iv)) can be constructed free of FSI.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nWhile a comprehensive FSI analysis was possible using the combined table, several critical details are missing or unclear based solely on the provided excerpts:\n\n1.  **Specific Basic FSI Regulation:** The primary regulation detailing the Zonal (Basic) FSI (Regulation 30(A)(1)) is not provided, making it impossible to verify the 1.33 figure independently of Table 12.\n2.  **Premium Calculation Formula for Table 12 FSI:** The exact formula for calculating the premium for the 0.73 FSI component listed in Table 12 is missing. The context only provided detailed premium formulas for IT/ITES developments (Page 177) and Public Parking Lots (PPL) (Page 182), which are not directly applicable to general R-Zone premium FSI.\n3.  **Maximum Permissible Height:** The maximum permissible height for a Residential building on a 20.0 m road in the Island City is not specified in the excerpts. The proposed height of 15.0 m must be checked against the specific height regulations which usually depend on road width, fire safety norms, and surrounding infrastructure.\n4.  **TDR Acquisition Status:** It is assumed the developer will utilize the maximum TDR (0.64 FSI) to reach the 2.7 cap; however, the actual procurement status of the TDR is unknown.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Verify ASR and Premium Rate:** Obtain the current Annual Statement of Rates (ASR) for the specific location in the Island City to accurately calculate the statutory premium payable for the 1460.0 sq. m. of Premium FSI (0.73 FSI).\n2.  **Confirm Height Restrictions:** Consult DCPR-2034 regulations (specifically Part III, General Building Requirements) to confirm that the proposed height of 15.0 m adheres to the maximum limits imposed by the 20.0 m road width and fire safety standards.\n3.  **Detailed FSI Exemption Plan:** Prepare a detailed plan showing all areas proposed to be exempted from FSI (e.g., parking, stilt, specific staircase/lift areas) to ensure compliance with Regulation 31(1) and determine any additional associated premiums (e.g., for free-of-FSI staircase/lift areas).\n4.  **TDR Strategy:** Initiate the process for acquiring or utilizing TDR certificates corresponding to 1280.0 sq. m. of BUA (0.64 FSI) if the maximum potential is desired.\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based exclusively on the provided textual excerpts from the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 (DCPR-2034). It assumes the provided context represents the comprehensive and current regulations applicable to the stated parameters. Actual development permissions require verification of all local codes, official plan notations, and final approval from the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM).",
