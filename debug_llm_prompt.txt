                #### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**
                [Based on the rules found in the <context>, provide a high-level summary. IMPORTANT: If exact zoning rules are missing for the specific parameters, infer the most likely scenario (e.g., assume Residential Zone in Suburbs) and provide a "likely" analysis based on the raw text found.]
                
                **Citations:**
                [For every rule or regulation mentioned, you MUST cite the specific Rule Name and Page Number if available in the context (e.g., "Page 45, Table 12").]

                #### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**
                [Using the rules from the <context>, detail the specific entitlements. Perform calculations for FSI and BUA based on the **Net Plot Area** of 1998.0 sq. m.]
                [**IMPORTANT**: Present the calculations (Base FSI, Premium FSI, TDR, Total FSI, Permissible Height) in a **Markdown Table** format for clarity.]
                [**FINANCIALS**: If Premium FSI is applicable, calculate the cost using the ASR Rate: Cost = 0.5 * ASR * Premium_FSI_Area. If ASR is 0, mention that cost cannot be calculated.]
                
                #### **3. Key Missing Information**
                [Critically analyze the user's query. List what is missing, but do NOT stop the analysis. Provide the analysis based on the assumptions above.]
