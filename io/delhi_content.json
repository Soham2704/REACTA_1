The city will be a\nprime mover and nerve centre of ideas and actions, the seat of national governance and a\ncentre of business, culture, education and sports.\n\nApart from critical issues such as land, physical infrastructure, transport, ecology and\nenvironment, housing, socio-cultural and other institutional facilities, the cornerstone for\nmaking Delhi a world-class city is the planning process itself and related aspects of\ngovernance and management. This needs a co-ordinated and integrated approach\namongst several agencies involved with urban services and development along with a\nparticipatory planning process at local levels.\n\nVISION\n\n3.\n\nVision-2021 is to make Delhi a global metropolis and a world-class city, where all the\npeople would be engaged in productive work with a better quality of life, living in a\nsustainable environment. This will, amongst other things, necessitate planning and action\nto meet the challenge of population growth and in-migration into Delhi; provision of\nadequate housing, particularly for the weaker sections of the society; addressing the\nproblems of small enterprises, particularly in the unorganized informal sector; dealing\nwith the issue of slums, up-gradation of old and dilapidated areas of the city; provision of\nadequate infrastructure services; conservation of the environment; preservation of Delhi's\nheritage and blending it with the new and complex modern patterns of development; and\ndoing all this within a framework of sustainable development, public private and\ncommunity participation and a spirit of ownership and a sense of belonging among its\ncitizens.\n\nREVIEW OF PAST EXPERIENCE\n\n4.\n\nThe process of planned development of the National Capital began with enactment of the\nDelhi Development Act 1957, followed by the promulgation of the Master Plan of Delhi in\n1962 (MPD-62).\n\nThe MPD-62 set out the broad vision for the development of Delhi and, with a view to\nrealizing the development plan underlying this vision, a scheme of Large Scale Acquisition\nand Development of Land was also formulated. The aim of the latter was to ensure that the\nspatial pattern of development and use of land could conform to the development plan\nand infrastructure and services could be laid out to match the same. At that early stage,\nthe process of planned development was envisaged as a public sector led process with\nvery little private participation in terms of development of both, shelter and infrastructure\nservices. The philosophy of public sector led growth and development process continued\nin general till the process of economic reforms was initiated in the early nineties.\nTherefore, the Master Plan for Delhi 2001 (MPD-2001) also substantially reiterated the\n\n"

These plans could be seen mainly\nas land use plans with a three level hierarchy i.e. Master Plan, Zonal Plans and Layout\nPlans for specific development schemes within each zone.\n\nThe population of Delhi in 2001 was 138 lakh as against the MPD-2001 projection of 128\nlakh. This has had its inevitable implications and impact in terms of shelter, including\nsquatter settlements, and other infrastructure facilities.\n\nSome issues that arise for consideration and are also directions for policy include:\n\ni) Review of the scheme of large scale development and acquisition and its relevance in\nthe present context;\n\nii) Alternative options for development of areas identified for urbanization in MPD-\n2021;\n\niii) | Evolving a system under which planning for, and provision of basic infrastructure\ncould take place simultaneously with reference to (i) and (ii) above; and\n\niv) Involving the private sector in the assembly and development of land and provision\nof infrastructure services.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of planned development pertains to the provision of\nadequate well-planned shelter and housing for the different categories of inhabitants of\nthe city. The quantitative and qualitative shortages and deficiencies in this regard have\nbeen observed while formulating the MPD-2021. In turn, this should also be seen in\nconcert with the involvement of the private sector in land assembly and development.\n\nTwo major challenges which have emerged in the wake of the developments outlined\nabove relate to the phenomenon of unauthorized colonies and squatter / jhuggi jhompri\nsettlements. This reality will have to be dealt with not only in its present manifestation,\nbut also in terms of future growth and proliferation.\n\nThe exercises done for the MPD-2021 show that there is a need for redevelopment and\ndensification of the existing urban areas and city improvement. This aspect is a major\ncomponent of the new Master Plan. It calls for a comprehensive redevelopment strategy\nfor accommodating a larger population, strengthening of infrastructure facilities\naccompanied by creation of more open spaces at the local level by undertaking measures\nfor redevelopment of congested areas.\n\nAnother important development observed during the period of the last Master Plan is the\nphenomenal growth of automobiles in Delhi. This has resulted in a variety of problems\npertaining to congestion, pollution, safety of travel and parking etc., which need to be\naddressed.\n\nThe NCT of Delhi has been divided into 15 Zones from A to H and J to P, of which 8 Zones\nare in the urban area, one in Riverbed and remaining 6 in the rural area. So far, Zonal\nPlans in respect of 11 zones (including sub cities of Dwaraka, Rohini and Narela) have\nbeen notified with the approval of the Government of India. It is pertinent to finalise the\nZonal Plans for all the planning zones within a year from the date of notification of the\nMPD-2021.\n\nThe experience of the past two Master Plans shows that projections regarding various\nbasic infrastructure services have been made with reference to the population growth\nprojections and the increased urbanization requirements. However, the infrastructure\nprovisions especially those related to water and power have not matched the pace of\ndevelopment.\n"

It also included extensive consultations at\nthe pre-planning stage by involving local bodies, Government of NCT of Delhi, public\nsector agencies, professional groups, resident welfare associations, elected\nrepresentatives, etc.\n\nThe Ministry of Urban development issued guidelines in 2003 for the preparation of the\nMPD 2021 which inter alia emphasised the need to explore alternate methods of land\nassembly, private sector participation, and flexible land use and development norms. The\nAuthority also had the benefit of the reports of 12 study groups set up with experts and\nstakeholders on various aspects such as shelter, demography, conservation,\ntransportation, industry, environment, mixed use, infrastructure, trade and commerce etc.\nDetails of the study groups are given in Annexure-V. Five seminars were organised on\nvarious aspects involving experts in the field, representatives of GNCTD and local bodies\nand NGOs.\n\nThe DDA has also made presentations on the draft MPD 2021 before various forums\nincluding the Consultative Committee of Parliament, Lt Governor, Delhi, Chief Minister\nDelhi and the Cabinet of GNCTD and the Group of Ministers set up by the Central\nGovernment. The Draft MPD 2021 was also discussed at length in the Legislative Assembly\nof NCT of Delhi and the suggestions made by the members were considered and\nforwarded by the Delhi cabinet to the Authority and the Ministry of Urban Development\nfor its consideration. A large number of representations received in the Ministry of Urban\nDevelopment from various interest groups such as lawyer, doctors, Chartered\nAccountants, traders, residents, etc were also considered. Personal interaction with\nvarious interest groups as well as elected representatives including Members of\nParliament, Members of Legislative assembly, Municipal Councillors were held by the\nMinister and Minister of state for Urban development at various points in time.\n\nThe Draft Master Plan was notified for inviting public objections / suggestions through\nGazette Notification dated 16.03.2005 and public notice in newspapers on 08.04.2005. In\nresponse, about 7000 objections / suggestions were received, which were considered by\nthe Board of Enquiry which met on 17 occasions and also afforded personal hearing to\nabout 611 persons / organizations. The Authority considered the revised draft MPD 2021\nalong with the report of the Board of Enquiry in three sittings held on 29.12.2006,\n4.1.2007 and 19.1.2007 before it was sent to the Ministry of Urban Development for\napproval. The Ministry of Urban development considered the proposal in the light of the\ninputs received from DDA and from various quarters and finally approved the Master Plan\nfor Delhi 2021 in the present form.\n\nThe success of Master Plan depends on conversion of the policies and strategies outlined\nin it into time bound development and action plans, periodic reviews and close\nmonitoring, besides the people's will and willingness to adhere to discipline in the use of\nland, roads, public space and infrastructure. Any issue arising from interpretation of the\nprovisions of this Master Plan will be settled by DDA in consultation if required with\nCentral Government.\n\nMAJOR HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PLAN\n\n18.\n\nThe Master Plan incorporates several innovations for the development of the National\nCapital.

It is a growing\nand expanding magnet of attraction for people from all across the country and also a\nub for the region surrounding it. Planning for a metropolis like Delhi, therefore, cannot\nbe limited within its boundaries.\n\nThe physical potential for further urbanization within the NCT is reducing\nalthough there is a virtual urban continuum between Delhi and the surrounding areas,\nwhich lie in the States of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. With the imperatives of growth\nand development, the problems of Delhi have become complex, which have to be viewed\nboth as a challenge in terms of the pressures of regular and floating in-migration, as well\nas an opportunity in terms of planning and development in a regional context.\n\n1.1. BALANCED REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn recognition of the above factors, the Central Government enacted the National\nCapital Region Planning Board Act, 1985. The National Capital Region (NCR)\nPlanning Board, constituted under the Act, is charged with the responsibility of\ncoordinating the efforts of the adjoining States through the instrumentality of\nRegional and Sub-Regional Plans.\n\nThe present National Capital Region (NCR) comprises of a total area of 33,578 sq.\nkm. including areas of Delhi (1483 sq. kms), Haryana (13413 sq. kms.), Uttar\nPradesh (10853 sq. kms.) and Rajasthan (7829 sq. kms).\n\n1.2. POLICY ZONES\n\nThe Regional Plan 2021 has been drawn up with reference to the following four\nPolicy Zones: -\n\ni) NCT of Delhi.\n\nii) Central National Capital Region - Central NCR\n\niii) Highway Corridor Zone\n\niv) Rest of NCR.\n\n1.2.1... NATIONAL CAPITAL TERRITORY OF DELHI\n\nIn the National Capital Territory of Delhi, the basic policy is to achieve\nenvironmentally sustainable development / re-development considering\nthe limitations of land and water with significantly improved quality of\ninfrastructure.\n\n1.2.2. CENTRAL NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION (CENTRAL NCR)\n\nThe Central NCR (earlier the Delhi Metropolitan Area) as defined in the\nRegional Plan - 2021, comprises of the notified / controlled development\nareas of the neighboring towns of Ghaziabad - Loni, NOIDA, Gurgaon-\nManesar, Faridabad-Ballabhgarh, Bahadurgarh and Sonepat-Kundli, and\n"

Together with this larger industries\nshould be located in the urbanisable areas in this zone.\n\n1.2.3. | HIGHWAY CORRIDOR ZONE\n\nThe NCR Plan has proposed promotion of planned and regulated\ndevelopment along the National Highways. However, while planning for\nthese Zones, due care has to be taken to ensure that the activities being\npermitted are segregated from highway traffic through proper green\nbelts, and regulated and controlled access to the Highways. The identified\nHighway Corridor Zones will also have to be notified by the respective\nState Governments with appropriate regulations for their development.\n\n1.2.4. REST OF NCR\n\nIn the Rest of the NCR (approximately 29,795 sq. kms.), the basic policy of\nthe Regional Plan - 2021 is aimed at accelerated development of the\nurban and rural areas. For this, infrastructure has to be substantially\nupgraded at local and regional level (both by the State and Central\nGovernment) in order to induce growth in these areas, specifically in\nidentified settlements / Metro Centres. It is felt that this will make them\nmore attractive for locating economic and allied activities and for\nattracting private sector investment.\n\n1.3. FRAME WORK FOR SUB- REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nAs a follow up of the Regional Plan-2021 and in consonance with, under Section 17\nof the NCRPB Act, 1985, a Sub-Regional Plan for Delhi is to be prepared by GNCT-\nDelhi. It is suggested that a High Level Group may be constituted by GNCT-Delhi to\nimplement the policies of the Regional Plan and ensure timely preparation of the\nSub-Regional Plan.\n\nAs already mentioned Delhi has a limited area of 1483 sq. kms., out of which about\nhalf of the area is already urbanized. For the remaining area, optimum utilization\nof land is required so that while providing for the urbanization requirements, the\nnatural features like the ridge and other major green areas, defined water bodies\nand areas of ecological importance could be conserved.\n\nIn this background, it has been suggested that:\ni) As per NCR Plan, no new Central Government and Public Sector Undertaking\noffices should be located in NCTD. However, this would be possible only after\n"

This will be related\n\nwith:\n\ni. Residential development types and their potential for higher absorption.\n\nii, Redensification of housing areas developed at lower densities and along\nselected sections of the Metro corridor.\n\niii.

Therefore about 48 lakh additional population is to be accommodated in the\nfuture urban extensions.\n\nDue to land constraint in the NCTD, the areas earmarked as rural / agricultural in\nthe previous Master Plans have always been under pressure for utilisation for\nvarious urban activities and have virtually lost their original character. In future,\nurbanisation has to be in the areas that have development pressure / potential like\nthe areas along the major transport corridors and fringes of already urbanised\nareas.

REDEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING URBAN AREA\n\nThe scope for development of urban extensions on a large scale is restricted due to\nlimitations of buildable / urbanizable land in Delhi. Therefore, the option of\nredevelopment through a process of reorganisation and utilisation of the land\nalready developed will be a major element of the overall city development plan.\n\nA redevelopment strategy for accommodating more population in a planned\nmanner is to be taken up on priority in all use zones for efficient and optimum\nutilization of the existing urban land, both in planned and unplanned areas. This\nwould have to be based on provision of infrastructure viz. water supply, sewerage,\nroad network, open spaces and the essential social infrastructure.\n\nTo encourage the growth impulse for regeneration in the target redevelopment\nareas, the possible incentives and modalities recommended include grant of\nplanning permission at the scheme level with permission to reorganize / pool\nproperties for planning purposes, provision of social infrastructure through\nTransferable Development Rights or Accommodation Reservation and reduced\nspace standards for unplanned areas, enhanced FAR for specified redevelopment\nareas and application of flexible concept of mix-use zones in Special Area &\nVillages on scheme basis.\n\n3.3.1 REDEVELOPMENT STRATEGY\n\nThe target areas for redevelopment will have to be identified on the basis of\ntheir need for up-gradation and potential for development.

Such areas are recommended to be\nplanned for redevelopment with higher density in order to\nmake optimum use of land resource as per the prescribed\nnorms.\n\nC. Redevelopment of Other Developed areas\n\nIn Delhi, including New Delhi (NDMC area), a large number of\nhousing, commercial and industrial areas are old and\ncharacterized by poor structural condition, sub-optimal\nutilisation of land, congestion, poor urban form, inadequate\ninfrastructure services, lack of community facilities, etc.\nThese are to be redeveloped as per the prescribed norms and\ndevelopment controls and with the initiative / consultation\nwith the Residents\u2019 society / RWA / Traders' Associations.\n\n3.3.1.2. Special Area\nThe Special Area as defined in the Plan has been divided into three\nseparate parts, namely (i) Walled City (ii) Walled City and\nExtension and (iii) Karol Bagh. These are characterized by a mix of\ndifferent land uses and have similarities in compact built form,\nnarrow circulation space and low-rise high-density developments,\nmainly accommodating residential, commercial - both retail or\nwholesale and industrial uses.

It\naims to ensure effective housing and shelter options for all citizens, especially for the\nvulnerable groups and the poor, by creation of adequate housing stock on either rental\nor ownership basis. It envisages the role of the public agencies as facilitator through\npolicy and strategic interventions.\n\nHousing has a strong spatial relationship with employment, social services and\nother urban activities. The policy for development of housing could act as major tool for\ninfluencing the efficiency and equity of urban areas, besides its direct role in the\nprovision of shelter.\n\n4.1 HOUSING NEED\n\nAs per the Census 2001, Delhi has 24.5 lakh Census houses under the category of\nresidence and residence-cum-other uses, in which 25.5 lakh households are\nresiding. This reflects a net housing shortage of about 1.0 lakh houses / dwelling\nunits. The households are accommodated in a variety of housing types including\ndifferent categories of planned built housing, squatter settlements, unauthorized\ncolonies, traditional areas and villages. The Sub-group on Shelter noted that up to\nthe year 1991, the contribution to housing stock through institutional agencies\nwas only 53% (excluding squatter housing). Therefore, the component of housing\nthrough non-institutional sources, viz., unauthorized colonies, squatter / JJ\nclusters, etc., is quite significant. This trend has continued in the current decade as\nwell and has to be kept in view while determining the plan and strategy for\nhousing.\n\nBased on the projected population of 230 lakh by 2021, the estimated additional\nhousing stock required will be around 24 lakh dwelling units. This includes an\nestimated housing requirement of 20 lakh dwelling units for additional population\nand backlog of about 4 lakh units comprising of 1 lakh net shortage and the rest by\ndilapidated and Kutcha structures requiring replacement.\n\nIt has also been assessed that around 40% of housing need can potentially be\nsatisfied through redevelopment / up-gradation of existing areas of Delhi. This\nmay be met in the present urban limits of A to H zones and in the sub cities of\nDwarka, Rohini and Narela. This implies that the remaining 60% of the\nrequirement would have to be met through 14.4 lakh new housing units to be\nprovided in new areas. In order to ensure that housing need is accommodated in\nthe urban extension, the Zonal Plans for 2021 should be prepared within 12\nmonths.\n\nKeeping in view the socio-economic composition of the population, it is estimated\nthat around 50-55% of the housing requirement would be for the urban poor and\n\n32\n"

Unauthorised / Regularised Unauthorised Colonies\nUnauthorised colonies in Delhi pose a serious human\nproblem as a huge population is living in these colonies. The\nissue of existing unauthorized colonies has engaged attention\nsince the mid-seventies when a policy for regularization was\nformulated. 567 out of 607 listed unauthorized colonies were\nregularised till October 1993, but many more unauthorized\ncolonies have come up since then. Such colonies are to be\nidentified by the Govt. of NCTD.\n\nThe present method of regularization of unauthorized\ncolonies is by the provision of basic infrastructure to improve\nthe environment. However, regularization has not really\nbrought in any tangible improvement. Effectively, the process\nhas only led to de-facto tenure rights on the land and access\nto services.\n\nIn all unauthorised colonies whether on private or public\nland, regularization should be done as per the government\norders issued from time to time. It must be ensured that for\nimprovement of physical and social infrastructure, the\nminimum necessary / feasible level of services and\ncommunity facilities are provided.\n(i) Physical: Plans for provision of services shall be\nprepared by the concerned local bodies.\n(ii) Social: For provision of social facilities, reduced space\nstandards shall be adopted.

It has attained the status\nof a major distribution centre by virtue of its geographical location and other historical\nfactors.\n\nAs per Economic Survey of Delhi 2001-2002, there are about 37,000 wholesale\nenterprises in Delhi with an employment of about 1.6 lakh. In addition there are about\n6,500 enterprises of storage and warehousing providing employment to 27,000\npersons. It is expected that the number of enterprises in wholesale trade may increase\nto about 66,000 by 2021 leading to increase in employment to about 2.85 lakh persons.\nSome of the major commodities involved in the wholesale trade are textile and related\nproducts, food items, auto-parts and machinery, hardware and building materials, paper\nand stationery, fruits and vegetables and Iron and Steel.\n\nAround 20% of the total wholesale trade enterprises of urban Delhi are located\nin the walled city, accounting for around 12% of the employment. The average\nenterprise in the Walled City has less employment but high turnover in comparison to\nunits in other areas. In order to decentralise wholesale trade, the planned markets were\ndeveloped at Azadpur, Naraina, Okhla, Narela, Keshopur, etc.\n\n6.1 CITY LEVEL WHOLESALE MARKETS\n6.1.1 EXISTING MARKETS IN SPECIAL AREA\n\nIn case of existing developed areas, all wholesale markets generated with\nhazardous materials should be developed in decentralized manner and\nshifted to the areas assigned for these. All unauthorized encroachments /\nprojections on roads / government land should be removed to facilitate\neasy movement of traffic. Further extension of the wholesale activity in the\nWalled City and its Extension shall be totally stopped by giving incentives\nand disincentives as under:\n\ni) Incentives:\n\na) The liasioning offices of the traders/ agents to continue in the\npresent location;\n\nb) Development of New counter markets for wholesale trade and\nwarehousing;\n\nc) The new counter markets should have access from National\nHighway, arterial networks and connectivity with MRTS; and\n\nd) Incentives such as Transferable Development Rights (TDR) and\nreduced taxes to enable start up / expanding of activity in the\nnew markets.\n"

A door-to-door industrial survey\nrevealed that an average unit employed 9 workers while 30% of the units employed 4\nworkers or less.

The almost unprecedented scale and\nspeed of urbanisation in Delhi has resulted in enormous pressures on the physical\nenvironment with a severe adverse impact in terms of pollution, and today Delhi is\nconsidered to be among the most polluted cities in the world.\n\nThe city\u2019s environment can essentially be seen in terms of two components of\nurban management- the environment per se, or the habitat, and services management.\nThe former pertains to the natural features and resources including: the elements of air\nand noise, water (water bodies-river, lakes, drains and ponds and ground water) and\nland with reference to open spaces, green areas and other surface and sub-surface\nconditions. The latter is related to the built environment and includes the\nenvironmental infrastructure - water supply, sewerage, solid waste disposal, and the\ntransportation network.\n\nIn the above stated background the following three fold approach and strategy\nwill need to be adopted.\n\ni) Management of Natural Resources and the related environment infrastructure and\nservices in a manner that would lead to optimisation of use of natural resources,\nand reduction/abatement of pollution.\n\nii) Conservation and Development of the Natural features with a view to enhancing\ntheir environmental value; and\n\niii) Development and preservation of open spaces, greens and landscape /recreational\nareas.\n\nA clear approach towards management of 4 types of wastes generated in Delhi,\nnamely Solid Waste, Hazardous Waste, Bio-Medical Waste and Electronic Waste, should\nbe adopted. The approach should take into account the need for adopting the Clean\nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) and the awareness of the carbon credits that can be\nearned and encashed through a planned and organized mechanism, to be developed for\nthis purpose.\n\n9.1 NATURAL RESOURCES\n\nNatural Resource Conservation includes management of water (surface and\nground), air and noise.\n\n9.1.1 WATER (SURFACE AND GROUND)\n\na) The surface water resources in Delhi are basically comprised of the\nriver Yamuna, drains and the lakes/ponds. The ground water in Delhi\noccurs in confined and semi-confined conditions, with depths varying\nfrom 1 m to 10 m below the ground level and in the alluvial terrain,\nseveral sandy aquifers occur at different levels upto a depth of 70 m.\n\n119\n"

The Yamuna river and the drains are highly polluted;\n\nii. |The supply of water for human use is too much in absolute terms,\nbut is characterized by iniquitous distribution in per capita terms\nin different areas, and significant wastage;\n\niii. | Assuming that 80 percent of the water is converted into waste\nwater, the capacity to treat waste water is grossly deficient;\nVarious options for the re-use of treated waste water must be\nexplored and implemented.\n\niv. The actual quantity of waste water treated is much below the\ninstalled capacity on account of missing links in sewer\nconnectivity between the generation points and treatment plants\nand choking/silting of sewer lines, etc. The missing links in\nsewer connectivity must be covered for its continuity from the\ngeneration point to the treatment plant.\n\nv. The planned re-use of treated waste water is minuscule;\n\nvi. The treated wastewater is being largely put back into the drains\nand gets polluted again before flowing into the river Yamuna,\nwhich receives 70 percent of its waste from the 22 kms. of its\nflow through urban Delhi which, in turn, constitutes only 2\npercent of the total length of the river basin stretching from its\npoint of origin till its merger into the Ganga at Allahabad;\n\nvii. A large number of the traditional water bodies in the form of\nponds, etc. (excluding areas of unintended water logging along\nrailway tracks, highways and canals etc.) have been encroached\nor have otherwise become defunct.\n\nviii. The standards for STP / CETP developed by Central Pollution\n\nControl Board / Delhi Pollution Control Committee should be\nadhered to.\n\nix. The public participation and education programmes must be\n\nencouraged so that the sensitivity of the water resource is\n\nunderstood by the consumers, students and RWAs.\n\nGroundwater is one of the major sources for water supply in many\nparts of the country. In Delhi too, ground water contributes a\nsubstantial quantity of water supply. Especially in new development\nareas, groundwater is largely being used as drinking water resources.\nThe Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) assessed the total\ngroundwater potential to be 292 million cubic meters (MCM) in 2003\nas compared to 428.07 MCM in 1983, showing an overdraft and\nreduction of around 130 MCM over the past 20 years. Out of the 6\nblocks into which Delhi is divided, significant over drawl / reduction\nhas been observed in the Najafgarh and Mehrauli blocks. Rapid\nurbanisation leading to reduction in recharge of aquifers, increasing\ndemand in the agriculture, industrial and domestic sectors, stress put\non groundwater resources in periods of drought/deficient rainfall, and\nunplanned withdrawal from the sub soil aquifers, have been mainly\nresponsible for decline in groundwater levels.\n\n120\n"

However, recharge of\nground water gets limited due to decreased availability of permeable\nsurfaces owing to urbanisation, and the runoff getting diverted into\nthe sewers or storm water drains that convey the water into the river\nYamuna. The annual rainwater harvesting potential has been\nassessed at 900 billion litres or 2500 million litres per day. If even\n25% of this could be harvested it would imply availability of 625 mld,\nwhich would be nearly equivalent to the presently estimated\ndeficiency. This is in addition to the potential for roof water\nharvesting assessed at around 27 mld.\n\nThe existing drainage basins shall have to be made self-sustainable in\nwater management by integrating water-sewerage-drainage systems.\nNew projects and upgradation of present infrastructure should be\ntaken up in addition to promotion of water conservation through an\nintegrated and a community driven model. Complimentary short term\nand long-term strategies as mentioned above will need to be initiated.\n\nc) Development of parks and green corridors along the Nallahs should\nincorporate conservation of ground water and water bodies. To\nrecharge the ground water, conservation of water bodies and\nrainwater shall be essential. The area near Najafgarh Jheel and its\nsurroundings and the Ridge can also be used as potential water\nconservation area.\n\nd) To increase sub-surface soil water through seepage of rain water,\nporous paving tiles should be used in the pavements and soft parking\nareas. All the new bridges / flyovers must have the provision for rain\nwater harvesting.\n\nWater bodies, having a minimum size of surface area of 1 ha, shall be\npreserved by the concerned authorities. Further efforts shall be made at the\nlocal level to retain smaller water bodies.\n\nAIR\n\nDespite various initiatives and measures taken over the past few years, like\nintroduction of CNG and EURO II norms etc., the air quality in the city, in\nterms of pollution levels, has continued to be a matter of concern, and has\nbeen responsible for a number of respiratory diseases, heart ailments, eye\nirritation, asthma, etc. The three main sources of air pollution in Delhi are\nvehicular emission (around 70 percent) industrial emissions (around 20\npercent) with a major element of this coming from the three thermal power\nplants, and from other sources such as diesel generator sets and domestic\ncooking, burning of biomass, etc.\n\nApart from the issue of pollution on account of industries, the major area of\n\nplanning and intervention would relate to transportation planning.

It has been\nestimated that buses, which constitute barely 1.2 percent of the total\nnumber of vehicles, cater to around 60 percent of the total transport load,\nwhile personal vehicles -cars and scooters, though almost 93 percent of the\ntotal number of vehicles, cater to around only 30 percent of the travel\ndemand. Such a huge share of private vehicles in Delhi, while serving a\nrelatively limited purpose in terms of the transportation modal split,\nobviously creates tremendous pressure on road space, parking, and\npollution directly and through congestion.\n\nPublic transportation planning must, therefore, drive the future policy. So\nfar public transport is largely seen as the transport mode for the not so well\noff and poorer sections of the community, who cannot afford to own/use\npersonal transport. An important element of policy would now also have to\naim to make public transport a mode for personal vehicle owners and users\nthrough a mix of incentives and disincentives. Apart from aspects like\nfrequency, inter-modal integration, a possible single ticketing system, use of\nparking policy as a means to influence vehicle use, etc., the quality of public\ntransport, particularly buses, would need to be significantly upgraded,\ninter-alia, keeping the element of clean transport in view.\n\nAnother issue which has been raised in the context of vehicular congestion\nand pollution relates to the policy of mixed land use, which will also have to\nbe carefully considered.\n\nThe other elements which would need carefully thought out policy\nmeasures would relate to the operation of existing Power plants to\nsignificantly reduce the pollution arising from them, and industries, both in\nterms of pollution control in designated industrial areas, and relocation of\nnon-conforming industries.\n\nAs per the Government of India Notification, it is mandatory for all\nconstruction agencies to use Fly Ash bricks or tiles or clay fly ash bricks\nalong with pond ash in the construction of roads / flyovers embankments\nand reclamation of low-lying areas. To control the ambient air quality of\nDelhi, it may be made mandatory that all commercial vehicles (like trucks\nand tempos) are converted into CNG. All Thermal Power plants located in\nthe NCT of Delhi should be gradually converted to gas based plants.\n\nNOISE\n\nNoise is emerging as a major pollutant and irritant as well as a constant\nsource of disturbance and health hazards. Against a permissible level of 50-\n60 dB (A), the sound level in Indian cities often exceeds 80 dB (A).

It also specifies banning of all noise creating activities between 10 PM\nto 6 AM, which may be adhered to by the concerned agencies.\n\nBy proper land use planning, such as location of public, semi-public and\ncommercial activities along major transport arteries, a buffer can be\ncreated for residential zones. Green buffer through thin leaved trees, land\nformations, mounds, embankments, etc. along major roads could also\nprovide effective barriers to transmission of noise. It is also necessary to\nimprove monitoring and effective implementation of the Noise Pollution\n(Level) Rules 2000 and, to notify certain areas as \u2018No Horn Zones\u2019. The\ndesign and surface material of roads and pavements should also ensure\nreduction of noise. The concerned authorities should prepare area wise\ntraffic calming schemes and a Noise Monitoring and Control Plan (NMCP).\n\nWorking in night shifts for household industries or non-conforming\nindustries in the residential areas should be prohibited. Areas located\nwithin the air funnel should be planned with due consideration of noise\ngenerated from the aeroplanes.\n\nEnvironmentally stressed zones in Delhi should be identified and local area\nenvironment management plans should be prepared for such areas,\ntogether with regular monitoring.\n\n9.2 NATURAL FEATURES\n\nThe major natural features and eco-systems of Delhi are the river Yamuna,\ntogether with a network of streams/drains that empty into the river, and the\nAravalli Range. Both of these are in a state of considerable degradation, and it is of\nvital importance to conserve and rejuvenate these ecosystems. This has regional\nbearing, therefore, surrounding states also have to contribute towards their\nconservation and rejuvenation.\n\n9.2.1 RIVER YAMUNA\n\nOnce the lifeline, which spawned the many civilisations and Cities that grew\nin the area of the present NCT of Delhi, the River Yamuna today suffers\nfrom inadequate flow and quantum of water and an extremely high degree\nof pollution. The length of the river in the NCT of Delhi is 48 kms from Palla\nin the North to Okhla in the South, with a total river bed/flood plane area of\naround 97 sq.kms. which is about 7 percent of the total area of Delhi. A little\nover 50 percent of the river lies North of Wazirabad and the rest, around 22\nkms,, to its South, in the Urban area of Delhi. Apart from being the main\nsources of water supply for Delhi, it is one of the major sources of ground\nwater recharge. However, over the years, rapid urbanisation,\n\n123\n"

Similarly, at all locations, except Palla, the total\ncoliform levels are many times higher than the minimum tolerable\nstandards for drinking and bathing purposes.\n\nThe major source of pollution in the river to the extent of about 80%, is the\ndischarge of treated and untreated waste water through the 22 major\ndrains, which flow into the river(Annexure-I). The CPCB data shows that\nsix of these drains viz. the Najafgarh and the Supplementary Drain, the\nShahdara Drain, the Drain near Sarita Vihar, the Maharani Bagh Drain, the\nBarapulla drain and the Sen Nursing Home Drain contribute almost 90\npercent of the flow and 80 percent BOD load levels respectively.\n\nThe concerned agencies must ensure that through public awareness\ncampaigns, people are discouraged from throwing garbage into the river or\nthe drains and measures are taken to prevent throwing of garbage by the\nhabitations along side. Regular de-silting of the drains should also be\nundertaken.\n\n1. Measures for rejuvenation of River Yamuna\n\na) The issue of pollution in the river Yamuna has engaged the\nattention of the Supreme Court for the last several years, and it\nconstituted a Committee with Secretary, Ministry of Urban\nDevelopment as a Member, to draw up an Action plan for the\ncleaning/rejuvenation of the Yamuna River. A summary of the\nrecommendations of the Committee is given in Annexure II.\n\nb) Apart from the above measures, steps would also need to be taken\nto augment ground recharge from the river and decentralised\nwastewater treatment system. The creation of \u2018regulated flood\nplane reservoirs\u2019, for storing the excess monsoon overflow at\nsuitable locations would augment the water retention capacity of\nthe riverbed. The upstream of Wazirabad Barrage and some other\nareas offer such a potential. To facilitate ground water recharge it\nmay also be ensured that minimum required flow in the river\nduring lean season exists. The reservoirs may be created in low-\nlying areas.\n\nc) At another level, a strategy for the conservation/development of\nthe Yamuna River Bed area needs to be developed and\nimplemented in a systematic manner. This issue is sensitive both\nin terms of the environment and public perceptions. Any such\nstrategy will need to take into account the cycle of flood\noccurrences and flood zones, the ground water recharge potentials\n\n124\n"

The Master Plan of Delhi - 2001 identified the Regional Park into\nfour parts as below:\n\n1. Northern Ridge 87 ha.\n\n2. Central Ridge 864 ha.\n3. South Central Ridge (Mehrauli) 626 ha.\n4. Southern Ridge 6200 ha.\n\nSubject to verification, the area of Regional Park is 7777 [ha].

There are discrepancies between\nthe area notified and the physical boundaries of the total area owned by\nvarious agencies - DDA, CPWD, NDMC, 2[concerned municipal body], Forest\nDepartment and the Ministry of Defence. Till the exact boundaries are\nidentified by the Forest Department, the boundary indicated in the Master\nPlan for Delhi (land use plan) as Regional Park shall continue.\n\n9.3 GREEN / RECREATIONAL AREAS\n\nDelhi has a much larger green cover than any of the other metropolitan city in the\ncountry, and could well be called a \u201cGreen City\u2019. The green / recreational use\nconstitutes 8,722 ha of land as per MPD 2001, which is around 19% of the total\nurban land area of 44,777 ha. This includes 1577 ha. under the Northern, Central\nand South Central Ridge (the remaining area of the Ridge is in the rural area). The\nbalance area under recreational/ green use i.e. 7145 ha. is in the form of District\nParks, City Parks, Community Parks etc. comprising around 15% of the total urban\nland area. In addition to this, a large chunk of green area is provided in the form of\nNeighborhood Parks / Tot lots in the gross residential use zones, plantations /\ngreens in large campuses like President\u2019s Estate, JNU, IARI, Delhi University,\nplantations along drains and roadside plantations.

The process of\narranging these elements both functionally and beautifully is the essence of Urban\nDesign. Delhi had a traditional Urban Design, which is reflected in the glory of 17\"\ncentury Shahajahanabad and New Delhi. In the course of time Delhi has been becoming\namorphous aggregate of masses and voids.\n\nThe Walled City of Shahjahanabad has certain urban form characteristics. The\nJama Masjid is a dominating feature located on hilltop and is different, both in form and\nscale from the other developments of the city. The boulevard of Chandni Chowk was its\ncommercial centerpiece, with certain visual character terminating at two landmarks viz.\nRed Fort and Fatehpuri Mosque at its ends.\n\nIn the planning of New Delhi in 1916, the Central Vista was conceived as a\nlandscaped stretch to form continuity between the ridge and the river Yamuna. The\nstretch with the Rashtrapati Bhawan and the India Gate at two ends has tremendous\nvisual quality and is one of the finest examples of Urban Design and monumentality in\nplanning in the world. The Jama Masjid was visually linked with Parliament House and\nConnaught Place.\n\nThe following aspects need to be considered to arrive at the basis for policies\naffecting the urban fabric:\ni) Areas of significance in built environment.\nii) Visual integration of the city.\niii) Policy for tall buildings.\niv) Policy on unhindered access movement, parking and pedestrian realm.\nv) Policy on Hoardings, Street furniture and Signage.\nvi) Urban Design Scheme.\nvii) Policy for design of pedestrian realm.\nviii) City structure plan and Urban Design objective.\nix) Policy for conservation of Heritage precincts Buildings and Zones.\n\n11.1 SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT\nThe areas identified for Urban Design guidelines are as given below:\n11.1.1.

There has been a rise\nin per capita trip rate (excluding walk trips) from 0.72 in 1981 to 0.87 in 2001 and\nexponentially more in 2011. Keeping in view the population growth, this translates into\nan increase from 45 lakh trips to around 118 lakh trips in 2001 and 144 lakh trips till\n2008. As per the Transport Demand Forecast Study (TDFS) undertaken by GNCTD and\napproved by the UTTIPEC in 2011, it is seen that between 2001 and 2008, the private\nmotor vehicle trips have increased from 28% to 35% and non-motorized vehicle trips\nfrom 9% to 15%, however bus trips have unfortunately decreased from 60% to 42% of\nthe total number of trips.\n\nBesides the above, Delhi has developed as a seamless city and an urban\ncontinuum comprising of a number of rapidly growing towns in Haryana and UP. This\nhas added to the flow and movement of traffic within Delhi.\n\nDespite measures by way of increasing the length of the road network and road\nsurface space through widening, construction of a number of flyovers / grade\nseparators and, launching of the Metro, the traffic congestion has continued to increase\nunabated. This has its inevitable consequences in terms of accidents, pollution,\ncommuting time, and wasteful energy / fuel consumption.\n\nBased on the rate of increase in the number of trips between 1981 and\n2001/2011, it is estimated that the total trips would rise to 280 lakh by the year 2021,\nincluding 257 lakh motorized trips and 23 lakh non-motorized trips. In this context, it\nneeds to be noted that roads already occupy approx. 21 percent of the total area of the\ncity, which clearly limits the potential for increase in road space.\n\nApart from the problems and requirements of transportation at the macro level,\nthere are special problems in specific areas, particularly the old city, which deserve\nspecial attention. Special requirements also tend to arise from the mega events such as\nthe Commonwealth Games.\n\nThe plan and strategy for transportation will have to be worked out in this\nbackground. The broad aim of this would be to ensure safe and economical commuting\nbetween place of origin and destination, convenient and quick access to all areas for all\nsections of the society, reduction of pollution and congestion, energy efficiency and\nconservation, safety for all sections of the road and transport users and, towards\nmeeting these objectives, providing a significant increase in efficient rapid public\ntransport systems and facilities with a corresponding reduction in individual private\ntransport usage. This is in addition to pedestrianisation and properly planned use of\nnon-motorised transport systems throughout the city.\n\nThe National Urban Transport Policy, 2006 had also recognized that \u2018people\noccupy center stage in our cities and all plans would be for their common benefit and\n\n\u2018 Chapter revised vide S.O. 1914(E) dated 14-07-2015\n141\n"

National Highways\n\nAll National Highways (5 Nos.) are connected to the city\u2019s Ring-Radial arterial\nroad network system resulting in regional traffic passing through the city in\nabsence of any bypass. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) should\nincorporate the Street Design Regulations [Annexure-12.0 (I)] while\ndesigning the National highways in Delhi during strengthening/ re-\ndesigning/ widening/ upgrading of the National Highways in Delhi as per\nperiodic maintenance by the road owning agency. The recommended Right of\nWay (ROW) is 90 meters, wherever possible. However, within the city it shall\nnot be less than 60 meters. All the National Highways within the NCTD shall\nbe access controlled upto the Delhi Border and follow regulations as per the\nArterial roads.\n\n2. Arterial Roads\n\nArterial Roads provide long distance mobility connecting one part of the city\nto another, carrying heavy volume of traffic of all modes. These include ROW\nabove 30 m, and need to have multi-modal high-capacity Public\ntransportation systems apart from private motor vehicular movement space,\nin addition to fully segregated space for pedestrians and NMT.\n\n3. Collector Roads\n\nCollector roads provide connections between neighbourhoods and also\nconnect local streets to arterial roads. All roads with ROW above 12 m to 30\nm may be considered as collector roads. However, the existing roads which\nare less than 30m yet functioning as Arterial Roads on ground may be\ncontinued in future also.\n\n4. Local Streets\n\nThese are intended for neighbourhood (or local) use on which through traffic\nis to be discouraged. The suggested ROW is 9 to 12 m in the existing and\nproposed urban area. These roads should be made pedestrian and bicycle\nfriendly by using modern traffic calming designs to keep the speeds within\nlimits as per design. A special cell should be set up within Transport\nDepartment for developing standards and guidelines for traffic calming\ndesigns and for their implementation in the whole city in a phased manner.\n\n144\n"

Further, the development of\nroads should start from the extremes ends of the designated ROW.\n\nThe following definitions for various components of Roads may be\nconsidered for planning and enforcement purposes:\n\ni) \u2018Right of way\u2019 (ROW) is a reserved space for movement of all modes of\ntraffic which includes pedestrian, cycles, cycle rickshaws, buses, cars,\nscooter, taxis, autorickshaws, etc. ROWs are shown on the Zonal Plan\nand Master Plan of Delhi with designated widths.

ROAD NETWORK AND CONNECTIVITY\n\nIn the current scenario, only arterial roads are forming the network\nsystem of the city. There is complete absence of a secondary road\nnetwork system resulting in restricted distribution of traffic over a\nnetwork and concentration of even local traffic on arterial roads,\nresulting in congestion on these roads. Further, closure of medians all\nalong arterial / sub-arterial roads to have signal-free corridors, have\nrestricted movement of traffic / people between neighbourhoods on\neither side. Moreover, connections between colonies are also not\nplanned to enable direct connectivity to local destinations, forcing\npeople to come on to arterial roads to make even short local trips.\n\nIn order to reduce congestion on the existing roads, it is proposed to\nidentify additional/ alternative links and access corridors to augment\nthe current network, with the following measures:\n\ni. Augmentation of road network to distribute high traffic volume\nover multiple roads, instead of stand-alone corridor / junction\ncapacity improvement strategies.\n\nii. Road networks to be planned with a vehicular route network of\n\napproximately 250 m c/c, as also specified in the NMSH\n\nparameters, 2011.

Therefore, the institutional mechanism for long term, regular\nmaintenance and management of roads needs to be strengthened by all\nroad owning and maintaining agencies. Maintenance of road and\ntransport infrastructure should be part of construction and retrofitting\nprojects by all road owning agencies.\n\nINTERSECTIONS AND CROSSINGS\n\nIntersections and crossings are the most crucial components of a road\nnetwork system as they allow directional traffic to move through the\njunctions, resulting in complex movements and conflict points for MV,\nNMV and pedestrian traffic. Intersections must be designed to reduce\ndelays and increase safety for all road users, with a priority to non-\nmotorized and public transport modes. The design of intersections with\nproper signalization and signage, markings etc. is very important for\nregulated and safe movement of all modes. Road owning agencies\nconcerned shall be responsible for installing the appropriate road\nsignages and markings, and maintaining them on regular basis.\n\nIn Delhi the average distance of signalized intersections allowing\nmovement of all modes, is very large. This creates barriers to movement\nof pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users for crossing the road\nor interchanging between modes or accessing destinations. To facilitate\neasy interchange between modes and allow local trips to be made on\nNMT or foot, mid-block crossings need to be provided at approximately\nevery 250 metres or less.\n\nIn addition, pedestrians including children, women, elderly and the\ndifferentially-abled, must be given the shortest possible direct route to\ncross the street, therefore the most preferred crossing for them is \u201cat-\ngrade\u201d with signalization, both at intersections and mid-block crossings.\n\nPedestrian signals should be synchronized with the nearest traffic\nsignals, for smooth movement of traffic along with safe pedestrian/\nNMT crossing.\n\nFoot Over Bridges (FOBs) are to be considered as an exception, not the\nrule. They are to be provided only under circumstances where no at-\ngrade crossings are feasible. For rapid transit corridors, grade separated\ncrossings such as FOBs may be considered in case no other solution is\npossible at grade.\n\nGrade separators may also be provided at junctions as per codes, where\nthoroughfare traffic may be in high volume.

In any case,\ngrade separator should not be implemented as a stand-alone project but\nas part of a comprehensive network plan with traffic circulation system\nand traffic management measures for an influence area around the\njunction.\n\n12.3.4. REGIONAL NETWORK & CONNECTIVITY\n\nThe primary function of the regional road network is to provide\nstrategic regional linkages for safe and efficient movement of both\npassengers and goods between the NCT and other regional centres.\nWhile this is essential, it is equally critical to ensure the mobility and\nsafety needs of local communities and neighborhoods are not\ncompromised.\n\nIn this regard, Regional Plan-2021 for NCR has proposed regional road\nconnectivity and transportation connectivity like Regional Rapid Transit\nSystem (RRTS) which have been incorporated in the \u2018Sub Regional\nTransport Network Plan for Delhi\u2019 at [Annexure-12.0 (II)] for providing\nstrong linkages between Delhi and its neighbouring states, with an\nefficient transportation links for performing work and other trips in a\nregular manner. The following strategies may be adopted:\ni) _ Discourage vehicular trips external to Delhi to go through the NCT.\nii) All national highways within the NCT boundary to be treated as\nurban arterial roads and retrofit as per street design regulations\n[Annexure-12.0 (1)].\niii) To segregate passengers and goods movements to improve safety\nand efficiency.\n\n12.4. MASS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM (MRTS)\n\nMass Rapid Transit System may be defined as any system with capacity to carry\ngreater than 10,000 persons per hour per direction. The Metro Rail System is one\nof the most important component of a Mass Rapid Transport System (MRTS) in\nthe City. The Metro Rail network for the entire city has been identified in various\nphases, which comprises of a network of underground, elevated and surface\ncorridors aggregating to more than 300 Kms. and is expected to carry 108 lakh\ndaily passengers with an average trip length of 15 Km. by 2021.\n\nPhase I and Phase II of the network are already implemented and operational.\nPhase III is under implementation and Phase IV is in the planning stages. All\ncorridors (including Phase-IV) are shown in the comprehensive \u2018Sub Regional\nTransport Network Plan for Delhi\u2019 at Annexure-12.0 (II).\n\nIt is expected that about 60% of the urban area will be within 15-minute walking\ndistance from the proposed MRTS stations, after full development of the system.\nAdditional areas could come within easy access and connectivity with the Metro\nRail through inter-linkages with other transport modes.

Further, due to development of economic activities along the Metro\nCorridors and optimization of connectivity provided by it, the ridership on the\nMetro is expected to grow substantially over time. Correspondingly, it is\nexpected that vehicular trips may also progressively shift from road-based\ntransport to MRTS, particularly, with reference to the longer trip lengths (greater\nthan 10 Kms) within the city.\n\nTo achieve the above potential impact of the Metro Rail System a number of\nmeasures will be necessary. These will include the following:\n\ni.\n\nii.\n\niii.\n\niv.\n\nPreparation of detailed plans to facilitate and encourage direct pedestrian\naccess to the Metro Rail System/ Station.\n\nPreparation of detailed multi-modal transport plans with reference to each\nmajor Metro Station, with particular reference to bus transport routes,\nwhich could provide inter-linkages and feeder arrangements.\n\nParking arrangements for all modes at Metro Stations, in particular for IPT\nand NMT modes along with all conveniences required for metro\ncommuters.\n\nProvision of Park and Ride facilities at identified points from where feeder\nbus services would be available, or convenient direct pedestrian access\nwould be feasible.\n\nFor any green open space / recreational areas taken up by DMRC for\nconstruction purposes, adequate compensation of green space must be\nprovided by DMRC by providing public spaces within the metro station plot\n/ premises, so that local population may also be served.\n\n12.4.1. SYNERGY BETWEEN TRANSPORT AND LAND USE\n\nThe concept of the Master Plan for Delhi 1962 was based on a poly-\nnodal, polycentric, distribution of work centres, largely based on road\ntransport nodes. A major fall-out of this has been distortion between\ninfrastructure, transport and land use. To achieve spatial balance,\ndevelopment should take place according to new corridors of mass\nmovement. This has implications in terms of land use planning along the\nMass Rapid Transport / Transit System. This would not only help to\nsolve, to some extent, the enormous problems of mass transportation,\nbut would also generate a dynamic potential for growth and\nemployment. This is particularly true for the Metro Rail System. In this\ncontext ?[area mostly falling within 500m radius around the transit\nstation shall be delineated as the Intense Development area. All TOD\nSchemes will be limited to this 500m Intense Development Area as per\nthe policy.] The concept of Transit Oriented Development (TOD) needs\nto be adopted such that maximum number of people can live, work or\nfind means of recreation within walking/ cycling distance of the MRTS\ncorridors/ stations.\n\n2 Modified S.O. 4614 (E) dated 24-12-2019.\n\n149\n"

To the\nextent that it meets individual or public transport requirements, it is a\nnon-energy consuming and non-polluting mode of transport. However,\nthere are several issues which have to be kept in view while planning in\nrespect of these modes.\n\nWith a mixed type of fast moving traffic on the roads, travel by bicycle\nand rickshaws is very unsafe. Data has shown that although\napproximate 35% of population of Delhi owns cycles, only a fraction of\nthem use cycles for commuting due to the lack of safe cycling facilities or\ncycle-parking facilities.\n\nIn so far as rickshaws are concerned, apart from issues pertaining to the\naspect of mixed traffic, this mode also provides employment to a very\nlarge number of unskilled workers residing in the city.\n\n152\n"

Social infrastructure can be looked at in\nterms of the facilities indicated in the City Level Master Plan, and Community Facilities,\nwhich are indicated at the layout plan level in various use zones. Together, these include\nsocial infrastructure facilities pertaining to health, education, sports facilities, socio-\ncultural activities, communications, security and safety, and other community facilities\npertaining to recreation, religious activities, social congregations and community\nevents, cremation / burial grounds etc. These are generally planned in terms of\npopulation norms with stipulated permissibility conditions and development controls.\n\n13.1 HEALTH\n\nThe capital city is strategically located and has many specialised health facilities,\nwhich serve the city population as well as that of the region, and in many\nrespects the country as a whole. As per available statistics, there are 23 types of\nhealth units (facilities) in Delhi. The total numbers of health units are 1914 and\nthe number of beds is 30,667. The existing bed density per thousand population\nin Delhi works out to only 2.2. The World Health Organization (WHO) has\nrecommended a norm of 5 beds per thousand population. It is estimated that the\ntotal number of beds required in the year 2021 will be about 1,15,000.\n\nThe following broad strategies are proposed in order to meet the requirements\nof health related infrastructure:\n\nii.\n\niii.\n\niv.\n\nShortfall in the availability of number of beds per 1000 population is\nproposed to be met through-\n\na Enhancement in FAR for various levels of health facilities;\n\nb) Promoting rebuilding of the existing old hospitals and;\n\nc) Shifting of contagious diseases hospitals from existing urban areas to\nthe proposed urban extension with proper seclusion facilities and\nconnectivity, and using the space thus made available for general\nhospitals.\n\nEssential provisions shall be made for Old Age Home-cum-Care Centres for\nSenior Citizens and Mentally Challenged by way of specialised / target\ngroup oriented facilities, which will also relieve the pressure on general\nhospitals to some extent.\n\nPremises earmarked for health facilities should also include other medical\nstreams like Ayurvedic / Homeopathic medicine, governed by any statutory\n\ncode / body.\n\nComplementary health facilities at par should be developed in the NCR to\nreduce burden on Delhi.\n\n184\n\n"

Sizeable sports facilities have been developed in the City by various\nagencies like the Sports Authority of India (SAI), Delhi Development Authority\n(DDA), GNCTD, etc. However, sports activities, so far, been dealt with as a part of\nRecreational use. It is also felt that many of the facilities, which have been\ndeveloped, could actually be seen as recreation and / or club type of facilities. As\na result, even though the DDA has developed a large network of excellent sports\nfacilities, over and above the facilities developed by the SAI, etc. there is an\nevident need for a properly planned and structured sports infrastructure in the\ncity which, inter alia, should also be able to take care of mega / international\nsporting events, such as the forthcoming Commonwealth Games in 2010.\n\nEven the various facilities, which have been developed as pure sports facilities,\nsuffer from lack of full and proper utilisation, and there are issues related to\nmaintenance and resources for the same. With reference to the latter, for\nexample, the Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium premises are, on the one hand,\npresently under use for a variety of non-sports related activities and on the other\nhand, the Stadium itself cannot be used for anything but sports activities. The\nlatter aspect, in turn, is characterised by gross under utilisation. This also brings\nout the need for developing and prescribing planning and development control\nnorms geared to planned, practical and proper development of sports facilities as\nan important component of social development and optimum utilisation of the\nfacilities to be developed.\n\nIn addition to the above, there is a trend for development of gyms, spas, bowling\nalleys etc. at neighbourhood level. Since these are mostly being established as\ncommercial ventures, provision of land / space for these should be made in\ncommercial premises.\n\n13.3.1 PROVISION OF SPORTS FACILITIES\n\nSports activities are an important part of physical and_ social\ndevelopment of an individual and, at another level sports activities have\na significant aspect of, and potential in the form of congregational and\ncompetitive events at the community, city, national and international\nlevels. Keeping this in view norms and space standards separately for\nsports facilities at neighbourhood level and city level have been\nproposed with the aim of development of sports and play areas for all\nage groups at appropriate levels.\n\nTable 13.7: Planning Norms and Standards for Sports Facilities\n\nSl.

There are 267\ntelephone exchanges in Delhi with provision of 140 lakh connections,\nwhich works out to be 145 connections per thousand population. The\nintroduction of mobile telephony has completely transformed the\ntelecommunication system in the city.

In the past, several\nearthquakes of Richter magnitude 5.5 to 6.7 have occurred in the\nNational Capital Territory of Delhi. Two major lineaments, namely\nDelhi-Haridwar ridge and Delhi-Muradabad faults pass through the\nterritory, both having potential of generating earthquakes of the\nmagnitude upto 6.5 to 6.7 in future. Such natural and man-made\ndisasters neither can be prevented nor predicted. However, with the\ntechnological advancement to some extent mechanism can be\ndeveloped to mitigate the after effects of the disaster. Areas of\nvulnerability can be identified and necessary measures can be proposed\nby the concerned agencies. The concerned local bodies should keep\nupdating the building bye-laws to safeguard against disasters and\nensure effective and impartial enforcement. Following policies and\nstrategies for disaster management are proposed:\n\n1. Pre-Disaster Preparedness\n\ni. a) Micro-zonation surveys should be referred for land use\nplanning and be considered while preparing the Zonal Plans\nand Layout Plans.\n\ne Seismic micro-zonation for selected areas having high\ngrowth rates should be taken up on priority.\n\ne On the basis of vulnerability studies and hazard\nidentification, which includes soil conditions, probable\nintensity of earthquake, physiographic conditions of the\narea, fault traces, etc., local level land use zoning and\nplanning should be undertaken.\n\n202\n"

The rapid and almost uncontrolled growth of population has put these\nfacilities under severe pressure, and there are significant deficiencies. Even a cursory\nanalysis of the present state of affairs, infrastructure problems could become a cause of\ncrisis. Sewerage and solid waste management are GNCTD affairs but water supply,\npower and drainage are Inter-State issues. Thus critical need of advance action and\narrangement is required for the adequate provision of physical infrastructure. For each\ncomponent a broad augmentation plan is essential to meet the projected requirement.\nGNCTD should prepare a detailed and integrated plan in coordination with concerned\nauthorities, NGOs and community groups.\n\nThe Master Plan envisages an integrated approach that packages mutually\nsupportive infrastructure components i.e. water-sewerage-drainage for recycling,\nharvesting and optimal use of water; solid waste-sewerage-power for power generation,\netc. Innovative techniques for the use of alternative technologies like solar energy,\nrecycling, etc., are also to be encouraged. The Plan accepts the need for institutional\ncapacity building, \u201cUser Pays\u201d approach and public private partnership as tools for\ninstitutional strengthening. To improve the efficiency and to boost the performance,\nmore community participation and decentralised management is required. Technical\nfeasibility of rehabilitation/ augmentation network of sewerage, water supply and\ndrainage is required on priority for old built up areas and the areas identified for\nredevelopment.\n\n14.1 PROJECTED REQUIREMENTS FOR THE YEAR 2021\n\nThe existing availability and projected requirement for physical infrastructure\ncomponents as indicated by the agencies concerned are given in the Annexure I\nto IV.\n\n14.2 WATER\n\nDelhi depends largely on river Yamuna and partially on river Ganga for its share\nof raw water. For sustainable development of Delhi, it is essential to ensure\nadequate supply of water in terms of reliability, quality and quantity. Although,\nDelhi has an average water availability of 225 lpcd, the distribution of the same is\nnot uniform. Some areas get 24 hrs water supply, whereas some get hardly 1-2\nhr water in a day. In line with the norms laid down in CPHEEO Manual 1999, in\nrespect of mega cities, after taking into account 15% losses, the minimum water\nsupply @ 172 lpcd will have to be ensured for domestic use for the projected\npopulation. The water requirement has to be made from river water allocation\nand ranney wells in Yamuna flood plains. The future supply crucially depends on\nthe progress of the proposed dams in U.P, Uttranchal and H.P; Satluj Yamuna link\ncanal and Sharda Yamuna link canal. Further it will also depend upon the\nconveyance system, which should be in place before the release of allocated\n\n227\n"

However to some extent localised ground water extraction and its\nsupply after treatment to prescribed level of quality may also be required to\nmeet up the demands. In addition, promotion of recycled wastewater based on\ntechno economic feasibility is also to be done by the concerned agencies for\nwater augmentation.\n\nTo improve the water supply in accordance with the projected requirement upto\nthe year 2021 Inter-State river water allocation is required to be worked out. All\nmeasures are to be taken to reduce unaccounted flow of water (UFW) and\nproduction losses at existing water treatment plants. The drainage basins shall\nbe made self-sustainable in water management by integrating water-sewerage-\ndrainage systems. It is imperative to not only initiate new projects and upgrade\npresent infrastructure, but also to promote water conservation through an\nintegrated and a community driven model, comprising of complimentary short\nterm and long term measures as given below:\n\n1. Towns/cities have so far been planned by their respective authorities for\ntheir individual needs. There has been total lack of regional approach for\nsustainable use of available water and its conveyance from areas of plenty\nto scarcity. The raw water augmentation should not be territory specific but\nit should be on regional basis irrespective of State boundaries.\n\n2. Recycling of treated wastewater with separate lines for potable water and\nrecycled water. For this, dual pipeline system has to be introduced in a\nphased manner in all the areas.\n\n3. Ground water recharging through rain water harvesting, conserving water\nbodies and controlling groundwater extraction:\n\ni. Groundwater extraction is to be controlled through registering\nboreholes and recharging according to test yields. Ground water\nmanagement is to be enforced by concerned agency.\n\nii, Focused planning and action will be required to be taken to prepare\nand implement rain water as roof water harvesting schemes both with\nthe aim of optimizing water use and ground water recharge. For this\nsuitable mandatory provision should be made for planning and\nconstruction of various schemes.\n\niii Blue print is required to be prepared for Integrated Water\nManagement of all the water resources in the NCR as well as potential\nfor water reservoirs in Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal. Further it\nis vital to identify all the potential surface water sources, ground\nwater aquifers and inter-basin opportunities for transfer of water to\nthe region. This should include water mapping, desilting of existing\nlakes/depressions for augmentation of storage of rain/flood water,\ncapturing the monsoon run off, rain water harvesting, reuse and\nrecycling of waste water and measures for conservation of water,\ninter-basin transfer of water. It should also ensure the conservation of\n\n228\n"

The concepts of \u2018zero run-off drainage\u2019, with retention\nponds, sediments traps and balancing lakes should be adopted, with a\nsegregated wastewater disposal system. A green network overlapping\nthe blue network would protect the ecology of aquifers, and also\nprovide a pleasant environment. Simple methods of site planning,\nwhich incorporate porous/semi permeable paving, drop inlet/down\npipe, sediment trap, retention ponds, etc. will contribute in\nmaintaining ground water table.\n\nYamuna River, major drains and canals, with indiscriminate dumping\nof wastes, have become polluted and foul. These need strict pollution\ncontrol measures and eco-sensitive land use controls. Water flow\nneeds to be controlled and stabilized and marked at each kilometer\nstation. The valleys should be zoned as water portals, so that these\nare flanked with greenery, farmlands and forests.\n\nOne of the prime objectives of development should be to live in\nharmony with the environment. Efforts should be made to improve\nthe quality of river-water, to secure its continuous flow and to\nencourage the return of aquatic life. This needs improvement of\ndrainage, waste water treatment and pollution abatement by\nsewerage improvement. The surplus water during the monsoons\nshould be retained in balancing ponds along the riverbed rather than\nallowing it to the downstream areas.\n\nThe drains and waterfront can be landscaped in the form of\ninterconnected parkways. There is no need for elaborate gardening of\nthe greenways, but wild, simple and natural stretch by itself would be\necologically important. Such trails could be one of the cheapest forms\nof drainage and recreation.\n\nWater supply in new areas should incorporate separate lines - one for\nwashing, water coolers and garden taps, the second for supplying\npotable water. All non-residential buildings having a discharge of over\n10,000 litres a day should incorporate a wastewater recycling. The\ncapacity of the sewage treatment plants / recycling plants would be\nequal to or more than the water inflow requirements so that it may be\npossible to treat major part of the discharge excepting toilets and\nkitchen discharge. Keeping in view the uses of recycled water, a policy\nshall be formulated for determining the optimum water requirements\nfor various uses.\n\nThe wasteful practice of \u2018drill, pump, and spill\u2019 has to be replaced by\n\nefficient methods of water conservation, use, and recycling as\nstandard and mandatory procedures.

Development of appropriate sewerage system with efficient\nsewage treatment is vital to facilitate balanced and harmonized development.\nAugmentation of existing inadequate systems / treatment facilities as well as\nadoption of new technologies of waste treatment demands special efforts.\nFurther, it is pertinent to point-out that the existing capacity of sewerage system\nin Delhi is grossly inadequate, as only about 55% of the population is covered\nunder organised sewerage system and about 15% under on-site sanitation\nsystems. Rest of the population does not have proper access to sanitation\nfacilities. The sewage treatment facility is also inadequate. The increasing\npollution in the river Yamuna is a major indicator of lack of sewage treatment\nfacilities.\n\nBy the year 2021 entire Delhi should be served by regular sewerage system. It\nshould be developed in a phased manner. The areas where immediate regular\nsewerage system is not available, low cost sanitation system by individual\nfamilies could be adopted as a short-range provision. These should be planned in\nsuch a way that in the long term regular sewerage could be provided. To improve\nthe sewerage and sanitation, the surface drainage and sewerage systems would\nhave to be developed in an integrated manner.\n\nPlanning of the city must incorporate land at appropriate locations for sewage\ntreatment plants (STPs), sewage pumping stations, recycling plants for waste\nwater, sewage treatment plants, common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) with\nsupportive distributive infrastructure i.e. conveyance system to be laid to carry\ntreated wastewater from STPs to the areas for alternative uses. Decentralised\nSTPs with smaller capacities are to be provided at the community / subcity level.\nPossibility of recovering energy/ gas as fuel from sewage shall be explored.\n\nThe liquid waste would be taken care of by augmenting the capacity of existing\ntreatment plants as well as through new sewerage treatment plants. The\nsewerage system is designed to handle domestic liquid waste @ 80 % of the\nwater supply, which has to cater to 1100 mgd (4950 mld) of waste water by the\nyear 2021. The wastewater is also generated due to the use of ground water\ndrawn from the boreholes installed by the public. The needed capacity has to be\n\n231\n\n"

The storm water and flood protection in Delhi are not local but have\nregional bearing including areas of Haryana and Rajasthan. The main drainage\nsystem of Delhi is such that all water collected through main drains, link drains\nand small rivulets is discharged into Yamuna. On the basis of topographical\ncharacteristics and existing drainage network, NCT of Delhi has been divided into\nfive drainage basins namely Najafgarh, Alipur, Shahdara, Khushak nallah and\nMehrauli. The blockage of natural channel is a matter of concern. It is mainly\nbecause of the encroachment by slum dwellers along the drains which causes\nchoking of drains and flooding in the upstream areas due to reduced carrying\ncapacity. The other major reason is dumping of solid waste in the drains causing\n\n232\n"

A time bound action program for\naugmentation and capacity revision of existing and new drains (due to increase\nin run off from urban extensions) is also vital. Check dams and depression/ lakes\nmay be designed for increasing ground water table and as storm water holding\npoints wherever needed. The design shall preserve the natural drainage pattern\nafter the development of an area.\n\nDrainage should be linked with the ecology and green networks, by adopting the\nconcept of \u201cbio-drainage\u201d.\n\nRegular desilting of drains and control of dumping of solid waste / malba into\nthe drains should be taken up. Public awareness program need to be taken up in\nassociation with NGOs and RWAs to make the people aware about the\nconsequences of dumping malba in the drains.\n\nOther measures essential for proper drainage are the following:\n\n1 Drainage to be integral part of Road Development Plans / flyover / Grade\nSeparators.\n\n2) A proper database should be prepared and GIS based drainage mapping\nand planning should be promoted.\n\n3) Sub-wells need to be developed under flyovers for trapping rainwater.\n\n4) Pump houses in low-lying areas should be provided with back-up power.\n\n5) Remodelling of selected drains may also be required considering the\nupstream flow in the region.\n\nPOWER\n\nThe present total availability of power is 3170 MW.

The garbage from unauthorised developments, slums, JJ\nsettlements, etc is not collected which further adds to the environmental\ndegradation. The projected average garbage generation upto the year 2021 is @\n0.68 kg per capita per day and total quantum of solid waste is 15750 tons/day as\ngiven in Table 14.5.\n\nTable 14.5: Quantum of Municipal Solid Waste (Tons/Day)\n\nLocal body area Existing capacity Projected generation\n2001 for 2021\nMCD 5250 15100\nNDMC 245 550\nCantonment 48 100\nTotal 5543 15750\n\nManagement of solid waste involves waste generation, segregation and storage;\nwaste collection; waste transfer/ transportation; treatment, recycle, reuse,\nrecovery; and disposal. For effective waste management, its segregation at the\ncommunity and neighbourhood level is imperative. The waste shall be\nsegregated and collected, in separate chambers at dhalaos. For this, involvement\nof rag pickers with RWAs, CBOs and NGOs is to be encouraged.\n\nThe projected composition of municipal waste for the Plan period is estimated as\ngiven in Table 14.6. For biodegradable and recyclable waste, which is segregated\nat the source, decentralised treatment at neighbourhood level may be adopted,\nwhile for non-biodegradable, centralised treatment may be followed.\n\nTable 14.6: Projected Composition of Total Municipal Solid Waste for 2021\n\nConstituents Quantum (in tones) Percentage to total waste\nBio-degradable 6000 38\nNon Bio-degradable 6000 38\nRecyclable 3750 24\nTotal 15750 100\n\n236\n\n"

Proper dumping, recycling and reuse of construction debris and\nfly ash have to be linked. Meat processing centre waste is to be recycled for\nchicken feed etc.\n\nConsidering the nature of solid waste and the economic aspects of its disposal,\nmajor part of solid waste especially non bio-degradable has to be disposed off in\nsanitary landfills. Recycling should be preferred than disposing off the waste in\nsanitary landfill sites\u2019 wherever possible. The segregation of solid waste should\nstart at the point of generation of the waste. It should be collected in two\nseparate bags of green and black colour. The involvement of RWAs and Rag\npickers association will reduce the quantum of waste drastically.

Apart from the planned residential\ncolonies built as part of Lutyens' Delhi as well as through the\nprocess of planned development undertaken by the Delhi\nDevelopment Authority, there are authorized residential areas in\nthe Walled City, Special areas and urban villages. Other planned\nareas include resettlement colonies and pre-Delhi Development\nAct colonies, including post-partition rehabilitation colonies and\npre-1962 residential colonies as per list given in Annexure-I.

A scientific monitoring\nframework is essential for:\n\n1) Effective implementation of plan within the plan period, thereby achieving the\nintended targets.\n\n2) Respond to the changing socio-economic needs of the people of the city.\n\n3) To check unintended growth within the city.\n\n4) Time lags between various implementation schemes and emerging needs of the\npeople.\n\n5) Review the appropriateness of the plan policies.\n\nMonitoring framework for targets of the master plan helps in judging the\nperformance of various sectors, which need priority. Critical aspects and their targets\nneed shorter monitoring period so that they can be constantly reviewed from time to\ntime.\n\nThe Plan period is proposed to be divided in three phases taking 2006 as the\nbase year. However, the targets, which are not achieved within the defined period, shall\nbe carried forward in the next phase.\n\nThe following table lists the different sectors, their targets to be achieved and the\nperiod of monitoring. This table is however, not a programme of development but it\nprovides a scale to assess the achievements in different sectors for the city\ndevelopment.\n\nHowever, infrastructure facilities at neighbourhood level should be monitored in\nconsonance with neighbourhood development / redevelopment scheme.\n\nTable 18.1 Monitoring Framework for Development\n\nComponents Unit Period of | PhaseI | Phase II | Phase III | Target upto\nMonitoring) upto 2011- 2016- 2021\n2011 2016 2021\nI.

This unit should also be in-charge of overall monitoring of\nimplementation of the approved development plans and layout plans.\n\nA suitable mechanism by way of high-level committee under Lt. Governor, Delhi\nis also proposed to be set up for periodic review and monitoring of the plan. To\nenable this, apart from targets arising from various infrastructure plans etc.,\nother action points emerging from the proposals made in the plan for various\nsectors would also be listed out, to enable monitoring of timely implementation /\nidentifying the need for any changes / corrections.\n\nMANAGEMENT ACTION GROUPS\n\nIt is proposed that for participatory planning, the following management action\ngroups and initiatives are taken for addressing the major issues. These groups\nwould work on following Planning indicators.\n\n18.4.1 PLANNING INDICATORS\n\nThe following would be the indicators of physical and socio-economic\nchanges to be monitored periodically.\n\n1) Demographic: Population size, Population distribution in relation\nto holding capacity, Age sex structure, Household size, Rate of\n\nmigration, Causes of migration etc.\n\n285\n"

The prevailing large-\nscale Land Acquisition, Development and Disposal Policy of Delhi (1961), allows for\ndevelopment of land through acquisition and subsequent planning by DDA. Acquisition\nof land at such large scale could not be conducted in a time bound manner and this led\nto a mismatch between the pace of growth, and the demand and supply for built-up\nspace and other physical, social and institutional infrastructure.\n\nLand Pooling is a new paradigm for the urban development of Delhi, wherein the\nprivate sector will play an active role in assembling land and developing physical and\nsocial infrastructure. Under this concept, owners or groups of owners will pool land\nparcels for development as per prescribed norms and guidelines, making them partners\nin the development process. For integrated planning of a sector, the land required for\ndevelopment of roads, utilities, greens and other infrastructure shall be made available\nto the DDA and service providing agencies for development as per approved Zonal\nDevelopment Plan (ZDP) and sector layout plans. Planned development will increase\nthe value of their land through provision of infrastructure and public facilities. The\noutcomes are expected to be world class \u2018smart\u2019 and sustainable neighborhoods, sectors\nand zones, planned and executed as per the availability of water, power and other\ninfrastructure.\n\nThis Policy is applicable in the proposed urbanizable areas of Urban Extension\nfor which Zonal Plans have been notified.\n\n19.1 Guiding Principles\n\ni. Pooling of land under this Policy will be done on the basis of sectors (as\ndefined in the Regulations) and as delineated in the Zonal Development\nPlans.\n\nii The Policy is open to all landowners who own land in the areas notified by\nDDA/Government under the Policy. Landowners with any size of land may\nregister and express their interest to participate as per the application\nprocess specified in the Regulations.\n\niii. In order to ensure unified planning, servicing and subdivision/share of the\nland in a sector as per Land Policy and Regulations, a minimum of 70%\ncontiguous land of the developable area within the sector, free of\nencumbrances, is required to be pooled to make the sector eligible for\ndevelopment.

It will\nresult in compact, walkable, mixed-use developments within influence zones of transit\nstations. This is a critical paradigm shift that can potentially improve public transit\nridership, reduce vehicular congestion, and reduce greenhouse emissions and pollution\nin the long term.\n\nTOD is also an important strategy for unlocking the latent economic potential\nand land values in the city. It will facilitate the development/regeneration of select\nnodes/areas in the city through planned intensification of uses and activities, infusion of\nnew infrastructure and improvements in the public realm. This will also allow the city\nto capitalise on the large-scale investments being made into public transit infrastructure\n- Metro Rail, Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS), etc, by facilitating the\nimprovement of old housing stock in addition to creation of new housing stock and\neconomic centres around strategically located transit nodes and opening up\nopportunities for value capture.\n\nThe following key outcomes shall be targeted through the TOD Policy for Delhi.\n\na. Optimised density and diversification of uses and activities: This will be\nfacilitated through higher FAR norms and compact mixed-use development,\nwith augmentation of infrastructure by respective service providing agencies,\nand application of norms for green buildings and environment conservation.\nSuch an approach will result in achieving an optimum mix of activities and\nhigher job densities close to public transit systems, unlock the development\npotential of these areas and facilitate value capture.\n\nb. Enhanced mobility:\n\ne Pedestrian and NMT friendly environment - providing highest priority to\npedestrians and NMT, through various strategies such as restricted and\nhigh-priced public parking, traffic management plans, street improvements\nand creation of a fine network of pedestrian and NMT routes.\n\ne Modal shift in favour of public transport through multi-modal integration,\nenhanced walkability and last mile connectivity.\n\na) Groups, with barrier-free universal access, achieved through place-\nmaking strategies for Improved public realm: Generation of a vibrant\n\n\u2018 Chapter added vide S.O. 4614(E) dated 24-12-2019\n298\n"
